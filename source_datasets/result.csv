11,11,"date:may 16,2002. email:edum@hkem.com. dear sir, i am mr.eduado de mello, one of the principal commanders of the union for the total independence of angola,unita.well needless telling a very long story here for our story is indeed interwoven with the history of the world and the liberation struggle in the southern african region of the african continent. the bubble burst just about some weeks ago today when my supreme commander, the late dr.jonas savimbi was killed in an encounter with the government forces of the mpla government of my country.the rest is now history but suffice it to say that i am tired of the unfortunate role of waging a war against my fatherland.i have therefore decided to pull out my troupes from the bush even if the other field commanders decide otherwise am therefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life and i have decided to make south africa my new home at least for the interim period until i am sufficiently sure that i would be welcome home whole heartedly by the mpla government in luanda the capital of angola. needles to say i was the single most important commander who was very close to the late supreme commander; dr.jonas savimbi.indeed because i am a brother to one of his wives,he confided in me a great deal.the result of such trust is my reason for contacting you i was the commander whom he sent to deposit the sum of thirty two million usd ($32million) with a security/finance company in south africa.this was immediately after the events of september 11,2001 in the united states of america.indeed it had become increasingly difficult to move large volumes of money around the world particularly for a liberation movement like unita hence the recourse to keeping the money with the security company in south africa. i have decided to inherit this money which was taken out and deposited with the said security/finance company as cash in hundred dollar denominations.the money is kept in my signature and would have been used in the purchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of continuing the civil war in angola.the supreme commander is dead and as already stated i have decided to quite the whole thing and this is without regard to the fact that other commanders may wish to continue ! i want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit the $32million.i am still in the bush here but i have been able to establish contact with the company in south africa to the effect that i would soon come to take possession of the money that i kept with them. note also that i deposited the money as a foreign national who is the head of a mining company in angola (never as a commander of unita). if you are able to cooperate with me over this am willing to give you 20% of the $32million.please come back to me through email: edum@hkem.com.the security/finance company is standing by to receive my instructions on this and i will link you up with them as soon as you are ready to take possession of the $32million. finally you are to note that in you reply, you are to state your residential or company address and if possible send a copy of your international passport so as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands. yours truly, eduado de mello _______________________________________________ dcms-dev mailing list dcms-dev@eros.cs.jhu.edu http://www.eros-os.org/mailman/listinfo/dcms-dev",1

28,28,"mr.vincent nnaji, standard trust bank ltd, lagos,nigeria. dear sir, i am mr.vincent nnaji, bank manager of standard trust bank,lagos,nigeria. i have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. on january 6,1998 a foreign oil consultant foreign contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation mr. james herbert made a numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months valued at us$20m ( twenty million united states dollars) in my branch. upon maturity i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. after a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the nigerian national petroleum corporation that mr. james herbert died from an automobile accident. on further investigation, i found out that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr.james herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. this sum of us$20m has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. no one will ever come forward to claim it. according to nigerian law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund. consequently my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money i deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as i tagged them to be photographic materials for export i am writing you because i as a public servant i cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m. i want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. all these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. this is simple. i will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. the money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. if you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. upon your response i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. thanks and regards, mr.vincent nnaji.",1

62,62,"(fax) to my direct confidential fax no: 234 1 7591666 dr. kataga bakori lagos, nigeria. 23rd july 2002 attention president/c.e.o dear sir, request for urgent business relationship. firstly i must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret. a member of the nigeria export promotion council (n.e.p.c.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your particulars to me. i have decided to seek a confidential operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and hope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business. within the ministry of petroleum resources where i work as a director of engineering and projects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our control as overdue contract payments, bills totaling thirty one million united states dollars, which we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a foreign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual account to receive the funds. the source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in nigeria which lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded themselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries. the present civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors and as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we have identified floating at the central bank of nigeria ready for payment. however by virtue of our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names. i was therefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of us$31,000,000.00 (thirty one million united states dollars) hence we are writing you this letter. the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed so as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government financial agencies. we have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation of some officials of the federal ministry of finance (f.m.f) and the central bank of nigeria (c.b.n). we are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or any other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main partner and trustee or acting as the original contractor. this we can do by swapping of account information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for payment. by this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, and prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company. this process would be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned. i have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction, your share as compensation will be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 million (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. the business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. also your area of specialization is not m hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. i have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. i will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your knowledge when i have heard from you. thanks for your co-operation, yours faithfully, dr. kataga bakori nb: please respond by sending a facsimile (fax) to my direct confidential fax no: 234 1 7591666 --deathtospamdeathtospamdeathtospam-- ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by:thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ spamassassin-sightings mailing list spamassassin-sightings@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-sightings",1

""as seen on national television"" ""making over a half million dollars every 6 months from your home for an investment of only $25 us dollars expense one time. thanks to the computer age and the internet, be a millionaire like others within a year!!! before you say, ""no way!"" read the following. this is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately. due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it really can make people money. the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in this program. this has helped to show people that this is a simple, harmless, and fun way to make some extra money at home. and, besides even if you never got involved in the program, the reports themselves are well worth the money. they can help you start and advertise any business on the internet. that is, these reports stand alone and are beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet. the results of this show have been truly remarkable. so many people are participating that those involved are doing much better than ever before. since everyone makes more as more people try it out, its been very exciting to be a part of it lately. you will understand once you experience it. ""here it is below"" *** print this now for future reference *** the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at. it can be started with very little investment ($25) and the income return is tremendous!!! this is a legitimate, legal, money making opportunity. it does not require you to come into contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave your house except to get the mail. simply follow the instructions, and you really can make this happen. this e-mail order marketing program works every time if you put in the effort to make it work. e-mail is the sales tool of the future. take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now! the longer you wait, the more savvy people will be taking your business using e-mail. get what is rightfully yours. program yourself for success and dare to think big. it sounds corny, but it's true. you'll never make it big if you don't have this belief system in place. multi-level marketing (mlm) has finally gained respectability. it is being taught in the harvard business school, and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods. this is a multi-billion dollar industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in the u.s., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm. moreover, statistics show 45people become millionaires everyday through multi-level marketing. you may have heard this story before, but donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show. dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch. without hesitating trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work. the audience, started to hoot and boo him. he looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response. ""that's why i'm sitting up here and you are all sitting out there!"" with network marketing you have two sources of income. direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business. residual income is the secret of the wealthy. it means investing time and money once, and getting paid again and again and again. in network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of others. the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers. fortunately, sometime later i reread everything and gave some thought and study to it. my name is jonathan rourke. two years ago, the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position was eliminated. after unproductive job interviews, i decided to open my own business. over the past year, i incurred many unforeseen financial problems. i owed my family, friends and creditors over $35,000. the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just couldn't seem to make ends meet. i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business. at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially!!! in mid december, i received this program via e-mail. six month's prior to receiving this program, i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities. all of the programs i received, in my opinion were not cost effective. they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not. one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year. it didn't tell me i'd have to write a book to make it! but like i was saying, in december i received this program. i didn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a mailing list. thank goodness for that!!! after reading it several times, to make sure i was reading it correctly, i couldn't believe my eyes. here was a money making phenomenon. i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me further into debt. after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out, i would at least get my money back. but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. so i checked it out with the u.s. post office (1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter, i decided ""why not."" initially i sent out 10,000 e-mails. it cost me about $15 for my time on-line. the great thing about e-mail is that i don't need any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of my orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. i am telling you like it is. i hope it doesn't turn you off, but i promised myself that i would not 'rip-off"" anyone, no matter how much money it cost me. here is the basic version of what you need to do: your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report #1 within 2 weeks of your first program going out. if you don't, send out more programs until you do. your second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for report #2 within 4 weeks. if not, send out more programs until you do. once you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. you will make $50,000+ but keep at it! if you don't get 150 right off, keep at it! it may take some time for your down line to build. keep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted. in less than one week, i was starting to receive orders for report #1. i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13, 1 had received 26 orders for report #1. my first step in making $50,000 in 90 days was done. by january 30, 1 had received 196 orders for report #2; 46 more than i needed. so i sat back and relaxed. by march 1, of my e-mailing of 10,000, i received $58,000 with more coming in every day. i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car. please take time to read the attached program, it will change your life forever!! remember, it won't work if you don't try it. this program does work, but you must follow it exactly! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place. it won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money! in order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal of 20+ orders for report #1, and 150+ orders for report #2 and you will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. if you don't reach the first two goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of money, it may take a few months or so longer. but keep mailing out the programs and stay focused! that's the key. i am living proof that it works!!! if you choose not to participate in this program, i am sorry. it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you. if you choose to participate, follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security. if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was, or you want to start your own business, consider this a sign. i did! -sincerely, jonathan rourke p.s. do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look like piled up on a kitchen table? it's awesome! a personal note from the originator of this program: by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal, could not have been created by an amateur. let me tell you a little about myself. i had a profitable business for 10 years. then in 1979 my business began falling off. i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but it wasn't working. finally, i figured it out. it wasn't me; it was the economy. inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945. i don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate...because many of you know from first hand experience. there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before. the middle class was vanishing. those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up. those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor. as the saying goes, 'the rich get richer and the poor get poorer."" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to ""move up"" or ""get rich"". inflation will see to that. you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with ""no risk""and ""just a little bit of effort."" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined. follow the program exactly as instructed. do not change it in any way. it works exceedingly well as it is now. remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. one of the people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name will be on everyone of them! remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. so my friend, i have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. it is up to you now! ""think about it."" before you delete this program from your mailbox, as i almost did, take a little time to read it and really think about it. get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate. figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money! you will definitely get back what you invested. any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. it works! -jody jacobs, richmond, va here's how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar$ this method of raising capital really works 100% every time. i am sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days. before you say ""no way!"" please read this program carefully. this is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making opportunity. basically, this is what you do: as with all multilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products. every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a product for every dollar sent. your orders come by mail and are filled by e-mail, so you are not involved in personal selling. you do it privately in your own home, store, or office. this is the greatest multi-level mail order marketing anywhere: this is what you must do. 1. order all 5 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you don't have them). * for each report, send $5.00 cash, the name & number of the report you are ordering, your e-mail address, and your name & return address (in case of a problem). *make sure your return address is on your envelope - in case of any mail problems! * when you place your order, make sure you order each of the five reports. you need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. * within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five reports. save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. 2. important- do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps ""a"" through 'g"" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. once you understand the way this works you'll also see how it doesn't work if you change it. remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work. a. look below for the listing of available reports. b. after you've ordered the. five reports, take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report #5. this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000! c. move the name and address under report #4 down to report #5. d. move the name and address under report #3 down to report #4. e. move the name and address under report #2 down to report #3 f. move the name and address under report #1 down to report #2. g. insert your name and address in the report #1 position. please make sure you copy every name and address accurately! copy and paste method works well,. 3. take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save it to your computer. make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter. your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $25). you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free! to assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much, much more. here are two primary methods of building your downline: method #1: sending bulk e-mail let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each. let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5% response. using a good list, the response could be much better. also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000. but continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs. with a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders for report #1. those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000. out of those 0.5%, 100 people respond and order report #2. those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. the 0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for report #3. those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. the 0.5% response to that is i 0,000 orders for report #4. that amounts to 10,000 each of $5 bills for you in cash money! then think about level five! that's $500,000 alone! your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000 + $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!! remember friend, this is assuming 1,990 out of the 2,000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone, or half sent out 100,000 programs instead of 2,000. believe me, many people will do just that and more! report #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and e-mail software. method #2 - placing free ads on the internet 1. advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive, and there are hundreds of free places to advertise. let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level. placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members. follow this example to achieve the staggering results below: 1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50 2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500 3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)....... $5,000 4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) ....... $50,000 5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) ....... $500,000 this totals - $555,550 remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each. think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate! most people get 100's of participants. think about it! for every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. that's it! always provide same-day service on all orders! this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report! available reports *** order each report by number, and name *** * always send $5 cash (u.s. currency) for each report. checks not accepted * - always send your order via first class mail - make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper (so that the bill can't be seen against light) on one of those sheets of paper include: (a) the number & name of the report you are ordering, (b) your e-mail address, and (c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider encounters problems). place your order for these reports now: report #1 ""the insiders guide to advertizing for free on the internet"" order report #1 from: randy dillard p.o. box 8 osprey, fl 34229 usa report #2 ""the insiders guide to sending bulk email on the internet"" order report #2 from: carla brown p.o. box 39093 sarasota, fl 34238 usa report #3 ""the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet"" order report #3 from: glynn schmidt p.o. box 19424 sarasota, fl 34276 usa report #4 'how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of multilevel marketing and the internet"" order report #4 from: christin joy cpo 2398 501 e. college avenue wheaton, il 60187 usa report #5 ""how to send one million e-mails for free."" order report #5 from: cheri gerhart 81719 lido avenue indio, ca 92201 usa about 50,000 new people get online every month! ******* tips for success ******* * treat this as your business! be prompt, professional, and follow the directions accurately. * send for the five reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in. when you receive a $5 order, you must send out the requested product/report. * always provide same-day service on the orders you receive. * be patient and persistent with this program. if you follow the instructions exactly, your results will be successful! * above all, have faith in yourself and know you will succeed! ******* your success guidelines ******* follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: start posting ads as soon as you mail off for the reports! by the time you start receiving orders, your reports will be in your mailbox! for now, something simple, such as posting on message boards something to the effect of ""would you like to know how to earn $50,000 working out of your house with no initial investment? email me with the keywords ""more info"" to find out how. and, when they email you, send them this report in response! if you don't receive 20 orders for report #1 within two weeks, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report#2. if you don't, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. once you have received 100 or more orders for report #2, you can relax, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in! this is important to remember: every time your name is moved down on the list you are placed in front of a different report. you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you. if you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business! before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in this program, answer one question ... do you want to change your life? if the answer is yes, please look at the following facts about this program: 1. you are selling a product which does not cost anything to produce! 2. you are selling a product which does not cost anything to ship! 3. you are selling a product which does not cost you anything to advertise! 4. you are utilizing the power of the internet and the power of multi-level marketing to distribute your product all over the world! 5. your only expenses other than your initial $25 investment is your time! 6. virtually all of the income you generate from this program is pure profit! 7. this program will change your life forever. ******* testimonials******* this program does work, but you must follow it exactly! especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. i'm living proof that it works. it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. if you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security. -steven bardfield, portland, or my name is mitchell. my wife, jody, and i live in chicago, il. i am a cost accountant with a major u.s. corporation and i make pretty good money. when i received the program i grumbled to jody about receiving ""junk mail."" i made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. i 'knew' it wouldn't work. jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. i made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 'i told you so' on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! within two weeks she had received over 50 responses. within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! i was shocked! i was sure that i had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. i am a believer now. i have joined jody in her ""hobby. "" i did have seven more years until retirement, but i think of the 'rat race,' and it's not for me. we owe it all to mlm. -mitchell wolf md., chicago, il. the. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. i was approached several times before 1 checked this out. i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. to my astonishment i received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in. -charles morris, esq. not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. but conservative that i am, i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. boy, was i surprised when i found my medium- size post office box crammed with orders! for awhile, it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window. i'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. the nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. there simply isn't a better investment with a faster return. -paige willis, des moines, ia i had received this program before. i deleted it, but later i wondered if i shouldn't have given it a try. of course, i had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then it came ... i didn't delete this one! ... i made. more than $41,000 on the first try!! -violet wilson, johnstown, pa this is my third time to participate in this plan. we have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money. the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. for your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. good luck and happy spending! -kerry ford, centerport, ny it is up to you now! take 5 minutes to change your future! order your reports today and get started on your road to financial freedom! for your information: if you need help with starting a business, registering a business name, learning how income tax is handled, etc., contact your local office of the small business administration (a federal agency) 1(800) 827-5722 for free help and answers to questions. also, the internal revenue service offers free help via telephone and free seminars about business tax requirements. under bill s1618 title hi passed by the 105th us congress this letter cannot be considered spam as long as the sender includes contact information and a method of removal. this is a one time e-mail transmission. no request for removal is necessary to remove (even though this is not necessary) press whenopportunityknocksssss@yahoo.com stop! if you never read another e-mail please take a moment to read this one. this really is worth your valuable time. even if you never got involved in the program, the reports themselves are well worth the money. they can help you start and advertise any business on the internet. that is, these reports stand alone and are beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet. at the very least print this out now to read later if you are pressed for time. --deathtospamdeathtospamdeathtospam-- ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by:thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ spamassassin-sightings mailing list spamassassin-sightings@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-sightings",1

concentration of orally administered gh1 <br> available on the market today. injections of gh taken in international units are usually prescribed to be taken as a shot, two times per day. the individual would be taking between 2 and 4 units per day. gh1 has over 2000ng per dosage and was created to imitate the body's natural secretion of gh. <br> </b></font> <font color=""#ff0000""><b> <br> </b></font> <font size=3> <font color=""#ff0000""><b> what is growth hormone (gh)?</b></font> <font size=3> <font color=""#ff0000""><b> <br> <br> growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which <br> is secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the <br> endocrine system. gh is a microscopic protein substance that is chemically <br> similar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first few <br> hours of sleep and after exercise. gh is one of the most abundant hormones <br> secreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughout <br> the body. production of gh peaks at adolescence. <br> <br> every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are newly made. <br> the body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously <br> dying and regenerating. the brain and the nervous system retain their original <br> cells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced to <br> store memories of every new experience. overall intelligence and the ability <br> to learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone. <br> <br> growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decreased mental function and loss of libido. <br> when growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the <br> all-natural potential for great benefit. growth hormone is an amazing substance <br> which is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the <br> proper dosage amounts. <br> <br> gh is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, <br> melatonin and dhea, that all decline in production as we age. hormones are tiny <br> chemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to regulate <br> the activities of the vital organs. the word ""hormone"" is derived from a greek word <br> meaning to stimulate. many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some of the <br> effects of aging; however, gh reaches far beyond the scope of these other <br> hormones. not only does it prevent biological aging, but it acts to greatly <br> reverse a broad range of signs and symptoms associated with aging, including <br> making the skin more elastic and causing wrinkles to disappear. gh also <br> helps restore hair color and hair loss. <br> </b></font> <font size=3> <font color=""#ff0000""><b> <br> the eternal fountain of youth?</b></font> <font size=3> <font color=""#ff0000""><b> <br> <br> our bodies naturally produce gh in abundance when we are young, and its production <br> gradually slows over time. the amount of gh after the age of 21 falls about 14% per <br> decade, so that its production is reduced in half by age 60. while gh is not new, <br> its availability as a supplement has been limited. specialized clinics and physicians <br> have been using gh for over 30 years on thousands of patients with consistent results. <br> unfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with gh, only the medical <br> profession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. another problem has been <br> that the large gh molecule, composed of 191 amino acids (protein), had been only <br> effective administered through injections. however, a new technology developed by <br> anti-aging inc., now makes gh an effective, affordable and convenient alternative. <br> </b></font> <font size=3> <font color=""#ff0000""><b> <br> gh production falls by 80% from age 21 to 61</b></font> <font size=3> <font color=""#ff0000""><b> <br> </b></font> <font face=""ms sans serif""> <font size=3> <font color=""#ff0000""><b> <br> growth hormone declines with age in every animal species that has been tested to date. <br> the amount of decline in humans falls approximately 14% per decade. <br> this results in the growth hormone production rate being reduced in half by the age <br> of 60. humans produce on a daily basis 500 micrograms per year at age 20, <br> 200 micrograms at age 40 and 25 micrograms at 80 years of age. between the ages <br> of 70 and 80, nearly everyone is deficient in growth hormone which results in sds, <br> or somatotrophin deficiency syndrome. these symptoms are part of the disease called <br> aging which the medical community has determined is not a normal occurrence. <br> healing ability and energy levels decrease, as does physical mobility. <br> those who want to maintain their youthful vitality and stamina should include <br> an effective growth hormone therapy as part of their health regimen.</b></font> <font face=""times new roman""> <font size=3> <font color=""#ff0000""><b> <br> <br> after numerous clinical studies, the following was determined <br> after 6 or more months of gh

206,206,"it was the spring of 1979. i was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles. each day in the cafeteria, i walked from table to table ... stealing other kids' lunch money. no, i didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made them a little deal. ""let me borrow two dollars today,"" i said, ""and i'll bring you five dollars next week."" the investment was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes. of course when ""next week"" rolled around and i couldn't pony up the cash, i promised to pay them even more the week after that, if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer. eventually the end of the year came and went, high school started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties, and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money. i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid, and i didn't even get beat up. hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn. first of all, greed is your number one enemy. you're not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when you're ahead. don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket. second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind. they are looking out for their own money, not yours. the ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and money managers, will always tell you that the best time to buy is now. according to those guys, the longer you keep your money in the market, the more money you're going to make. ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is ""never"". in a sense, they are right. if you put $250,000 in an index fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years. but here's the problem: do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich? hell no! you want the money now - so you can enjoy it. it's hard to make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old in a wheelchair. if you could make a million dollars in the next few years, what would you do with it? where would you travel? what kind of car would you buy? the fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich. if your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility is your ally, and stability your enemy. you want to see those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed by the four hundred point crash a week later. you don't care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long it was unstable. that's how you're going to make the money. what i'm talking about here is day trading. my father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30k and down 30k. in the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. the day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of xyz for a $25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade. he acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes. i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it. it's not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started. society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training. the truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money. popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring. they don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty dollars. they make their money only if you believe two lies: 1) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average person. 2) that using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade. here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely, positively do not want you to know ... the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying. after reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade, and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market, i've learned the following lessons: ** achieving financial success is incredibly simple. ** anyone can do it. ** it only takes a few hours to learn. when i discovered the secret to day trading, i didn't become wealthy overnight. if you want instant cash, drive to wal-mart. buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. the only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through hard work, knowledge, and determination. after learning the fundamentals of day trading, i started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks brought modest gains. the next few months gave me the practical experience i needed to really earn a living, and i was pulling close to a six figure income. in less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk, i had made my first million. the knowledge that i gained during those formative trading years i am willing to share with you in my new book, the master trader. you will learn from my mistakes, and from my successes, as i teach you the simple, secret formula for day trading that i've used profitably year after year. the income of the day trader can be staggering. thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes. the difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge. i will provide that knowledge, and i will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. average income of a day trader: 5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year 22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year 35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year after reading the master trader, you will discover extremely profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win despite the current market weakness. here is just a snippet of what i will teach you: *** make money whether a stock goes up or down. *** learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds. *** learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them. *** save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make. *** learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market! *** learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance for great success. *** profit on huge intraday price swings. *** make money on the biggest news stories. *** actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns. *** learn how to use the tools and information wall street professionals use. *** learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. it's time to ask yourself: ""am i going to listen to the professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell? or am i going to take control of my own financial future, and start making money right now in the stock market?"" who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy wall street stockbroker, or yourself? with the master trader e-book, you will learn everything you need to know in order to get started with day trading ... from choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional trading strategies that make professional traders millions of dollars. the master trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to understand and straight-forward book ever written about active trading. if you are serious about success in short term stock trading - order today and start paving the road to your own financial future. oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade? his high school friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market. six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the california coast - with cash. oops, they weren't laughing anymore. in a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading is the fastest track to wealth. if you're looking for a long-term retirement investment with no risk that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't your kind of game. but if you want the quickest possible way to make a fortune in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then order the master trader e-book right now. i promise to teach you all of the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading. you don't need to know anything about the market, and anyone can do it, with minimum effort. it's an easy game to win if you know how the pieces move. order the master trader e-book right now for only $49.97 by clicking on the link below: http://4tools4life.com/qs ****************************************************** our company is strictly opposed to unsolicited emails. to be removed from this list, please send an email to ""bulkexpert@yahoo.com"" ****************************************************** 7248ovub3-523mjzy7405imwk1-594fukk8569zaxp5-772umul47",1

why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? what purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) **...namely the dom and sister nation, the kingdom of enenkio (the marshallese name for wake island),...** (comment: nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for dom, but as for the kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of enenkio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, his majesty king remios, the sovereign of enenkio and eneen-kio atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) correction: the kingdom of enenkio is an independent sovereign state and the same could be said for dom. **...claiming to represent the mid-pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in agence france- presse.** (comment: the government of the kingdom of enenkio represents the people of enenkio, who are forced to live in exile from eneen-kio atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. furthermore, ""...an article in agence france-presse"" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the marshall islands government. my preceding comments apply. the kingdom of enenkio is not now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". we have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of enenkio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. in fact, we are currently working with a former nasa astronaut. one tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) **the marshall islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** (comment: the kingdom of enenkio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of which i am aware, and in my post, i am responsible for all published information. i would personally caution any ""..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..."" nations, companies or publications if i had credible proof to that effect. however, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any rmi ministry source. furthermore, the rmi has repeatedly attacked the credibility of his majesty king hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the marshall islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. we believe some officials in the rmi are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. to perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **a honolulu-based attorney created the ""kingdom of enenkio"" in the early 1990s.** (comment: mr. moore is not an attorney, though he was living in honolulu in the early 1990s.) correction: the kingdom of enenkio was established by decree of the owner of eneen-kio atoll [a.k.a. enen-kio, halcyon, disclerta, wake and 6-8 other names], iroijlaplap murjel hermios, who then was paramount chief of the northern ratak atolls [he passed away in december 1998] and was fully recognized by the rmi government. he declared the sovereign state of enenkio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their king over eneen-kio atoll, ratified the constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **it was based on a power of attorney agreement with marshall islands paramount chief mursel (sic) hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** correction: the establishment of the kingdom of enenkio was made possible by murjel's appointment of mr. robert moore, the adopted brother of hermios, alab of taongi atoll and a private citizen, to the post of minister plenipotentiary. the document of appointment was also a special power of attorney which granted mr. moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the united states from eneen-kio atoll and establish an independent state on hermios' and the people's behalf. **the marshall islands high court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.** (comment: since when is a special power of attorney an ""agreement""? the marshall islands high court has no record or knowledge of the special power of attorney, except as has been publicized by the kingdom of enenkio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over eneen-kio atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful rmi boundaries. the rmi has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of eneen-kio atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the rmi when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former iroijlaplap or monarch of eneen-kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) finally, i suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the kingdom of enenkio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent u.s. invasion of eneen-kio atoll, properly named by 'marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. then i invite you to our embassy in honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. be sure to view the documents at our resource center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. in closing, i would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. skip to next file top of page june 3, 1999- sir: the following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the kingdom of enenkio (thank you for spelling 'enenkio' correctly. the purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the kingdom of enenkio. ""fantasy island"" -- ""melchizedek passport scam reveals how the internet can take fraud to new frontiers"" by bertil lintner in bangkok, december 10, 1998: ""determined not to give up, pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to taongi atoll in the western pacific. according to a melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of enenkio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the u.s.-held wake island. in real life, taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the marshall islands."" http://www.feer.com/restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of december 24, 1998: ""fantasy island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00) response to the author: i am unable to locate the ""melchizedek press release"" you cited, indicating that ""...taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of enenkio,..."". such an act would be impossible and implausible as enenkio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over taongi atoll in the marshall islands. further more, melchizedek (dom) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. the kingdom of enenkio did enter into a treaty with dom on the 19th day of september, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. it declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. however, a prior agreement, signed in may 1997, which had nothing to do with the kingdom of enenkio, transferred mr. robert moore's rights to develop taongi from mr. moore to dom. it did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. this was made possible because mr. moore is the alab (one class of landowner) of taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to taongi atoll, from the principal landowner, iroijlaplap (paramount chief) murjel hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by mr. moore, who is also the adopted brother of hermios. now, please understand, that while mr. moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of taongi, which would have generated an income to iroijlaplap hermios, mr. moore wears another hat as minister plenipotentiary of the kingdom of enenkio. iroijlaplap hermios, also wore (he died in december 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as first monarch, king of the kingdom of enenkio and one as owner in allodium of eneen-kio atoll (a.k.a. enen-kio, halcyon, disclerta, wake and several other names). for you to state the kingdom of enenkio is ""...another only-in- cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of enenkio. and, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon his majesty king hermios, the sovereign of enenkio and eneen-kio atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. i suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the kingdom of enenkio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent u.s. invasion of eneen-kio atoll, properly named by 'marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. then i invite you to our embassy in honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: be sure to view the documents at our resource center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. in closing, i would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. skip to next file top of page june 2, 1999- sir: the following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your footnotes to history -d and e (disconnected as of 12/1/00). ""enenkio atoll- in 1898, the united states annexed wake island, in the marshall islands of the western pacific. after the marshalls became a u.s. trust territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that wake island was a part of the marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called enenkio locally. the u.s. government has consistently ignored these claims. the protests took a sharper turn after the u.s. congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by americans of the republic of hawai'i. king murjel hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern marshalls, declared wake island's independence in 1987. the marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. in return for his services as minister plenipotentiary in the united states, hermios granted american businessman robert moore land on taongi atoll in the northern marshalls, which moore has declared the dominion of melchizedek."" comment: with all candor, i cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. while i am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which i am assuming is not the case) in the history of the kingdom of enenkio, i am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. as a consequence of my service to his majesty king remios and the people of enenkio, i will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. for your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **in 1898, the united states annexed wake island, in the marshall islands of the western pacific.** correction: in 1898, the united states invaded wake island, the northernmost atoll -- actually named eneen-kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the ratak chain of marshall islands in micronesia and the central north pacific ocean. the author responds: ""rest assured that i did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the american acquisition of the territory."" **after the marshalls became a u.s. trust territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that wake island was a part of the marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called enenkio locally.** correction: following w.w.ii, the trust territories of the pacific, which included the marshall islands, was placed under administration of the united states by the united nations. while eneen-kio was well established as one of the marshalls, the u.s. only knew it as wake and, having lost many u.s. lives there in 1941 at the hands of japanese invaders, kept control of it. in 1993, the paramount chief of the ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of eneen-kio atoll. the author responds: ""i don't see much conflict between the two versions here."" **the u.s. government has consistently ignored these claims.** correction: the u.s. government has consistently ignored claims from the marshall islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including iroijlaplap murjel hermios. the author responds: ""i will note this."" **the protests took a sharper turn after the u.s. congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by americans of the republic of hawai'i.** correction: the eneen-kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the u.s. congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the monarch of the kingdom of hawai'i by a group of american businessmen and u.s. marines, and in the following year returned the island of kaho'olawe to the hawaiian people. **king murjel hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern marshalls, declared wake island's independence in 1987.** correction: king murjel hermios, who was paramount chief until his death in december 1998, declared the sovereign state of enenkio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their king over eneen-kio atoll, ratified the constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. the author responds: ""i will make the necessary corrections here."" **the marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. in return for his services as minister plenipotentiary in the united states, hermios granted american businessman robert moore land on taongi atoll in the northern marshalls, which moore has declared the dominion of melchizedek.** correction: after the death of the first monarch, his brother remios succeeded to the throne as second monarch and rules along with his brother, crown prince lobadreo, over the kingdom of enenkio today. to continue the commentary: the parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the kingdom of enenkio itself. since hm king remios also succeeded to iroijlaplap of the northern ratak atolls of the marshall islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. but that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the kingdom of enenkio. i have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. the author responds: ""i imagine that you are asserting here that moore's melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the sources & bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. be assured i will look further into\par this. thank you again for your response, captain

(june 7, 1999) skip to next file top of page june 1, 1999: news release part one background: on may 21, 1999, the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands posted a ""press release"" on the internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). the author, ""mr. joseph biglar, undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the kingdom of enenkio, nor with its monarch, his majesty king remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of enenkio. there is no valid reason to assume that the said ""press release"" is indeed an official document. the republic of the marshall islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the kingdom of enenkio, headed by his majesty king remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be marshallese nationals residing in the marshall islands. response to so-called ""press release"": this unprovoked attack upon his majesty king remios, monarch of the kingdom of enenkio, by the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands is wholly false. it is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the republic of the marshall islands, which has been confirmed by the u.s. state department. (see: human rights report) this public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the marshall islands government that any attempt to interfere in the business of his majesty king remios, iroijlaplap of the northern ratak atolls of the marshall islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. the rmi is unequivocally cognizant that the kingdom of enenkio: â» â» exists as a sovereign state as defined by the montevideo convention (1933). â» â» was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, iroijlaplap murjel hermios, in 1987. â» â» was established by way of a public authority, the constitution of the kingdom of enenkio atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. â» â» has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the dominion of melchizedek â» â» has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as - now quoting mr. biglar's statement - ""rmi geographical and political boundaries."" â» â» exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of marshallese customary law (reinforced by the rmi constitution), upon the acknowledged iroijlaplaps of the northern ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands. â» â» has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of eneen-kio atoll to the government or people of the dominion of melchizedek or to any other entity, including the republic of the marshall islands. mr. biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the republic of the marshall islands: â» â» also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the montevideo convention (1933). â» â» was conceived as a separate state by (un) foreign governments, which included the united states, china and the ussr. â» â» was also established under a public authority, the constitution of the marshall islands, ratified in 1979 by its people. â» â» has no relations with enenkio that allows rmi knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the dominion of melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the rmi to be condemned by mr. biglar. â» â» has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of eneen-kio atoll, which was not incorporated into the rmi in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former iroijlaplap or monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. â» â» exercises authorities founded upon the rmi constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of eneen-kio atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. â» â» has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the kingdom of enenkio in their every attempt to get the rmi government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of iroijlaplap hermios, and the rmi has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said iroijlaplap hermios. the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the republic of the marshall islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the kingdom of enenkio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the monarch of the kingdom, his majesty king remios, as head of state, the government of the kingdom of enenkio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures. furthermore, in light of the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands announcement concerning the kingdom of enenkio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the preamble of the constitution of the marshall islands, then you decide for yourself: ""with this constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal."" on behalf of his majesty king remios, we, administrators of the kingdom of enenkio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

[note: ofc = offshore financial center] response: this unprovoked attack upon his majesty king remios, monarch of the kingdom of enenkio, the sovereign state of enenkio and its noble citizenry by the u.s. department of state is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the kingdom of enenkio. it is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of his majesty king remios, the government of the kingdom of enenkio and organs thereof. the unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the united states to attempt to link the kingdom of enenkio with international crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. this public posting shall serve as

acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the president of the united states issues a formal apology to his majesty king remios, along with the government of the kingdom of enenkio, and the congress of the united states initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the united states of the islands and seas of eneen-kio atoll. congressional representatives to hawaii, the nearest state of the united states to eneen-kio atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. the united states is obligated as the self-assured trustee of pacific island states in micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic cleansing"" and her responsibility to enenkio is no less. for

readers from the ministry of foreign affairs: subject: a ""state of war"" declaration the kingdom of enenkio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the united states government.â the united states government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and the law of nations in ""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the northern ratak state, which then had formal treaties with the republic of germany.â the explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many marshallese.â because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on marshallese society have not healed. thus a current state of adversity exists.â following four years of attempts to cause the united states to evaluate the plight of the marshallese of the northern ratak imposed by its actions with respect to wake island, the government of enenkio, on behalf of the marshallese king, issued the ""'state of war', a declaration"" and broadcast it to the world.â the people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.â it was through this pragmatic initiative that the kingdom of enenkio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the ratak paramount chief, king murjel hermios. in retrospect, the declaration has had little visible effect.â while a state of adversity does exist, the hope for american recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.â the kingdom of enenkio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.â such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.â the kingdom of enenkio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the marshallese people. while the kingdom of enenkio continues to seek accountability of the u.s. congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the un charter, conventions of the united nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the u.s. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.â the refusal of the u.s. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the marshallese people to whom the u.s. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the united nations and its members.â your understanding is appreciated.â skip to next file top of page december 19, 1998: news release subject: death of the monarch of the kingdom of enenkio the government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first monarch of the kingdom of enenkio, his majesty king murjel hermios. embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 january 1999. memorial services, held in the marshall islands where hm hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional marshallese leaders. his remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. irooj hermios was head of state of the kingdom of enenkio, revered as monarch over the islands of eneen-kio atoll, esteemed as iroijlaplap and high chief of the northern atolls of the ratak archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. his successor as iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a council of traditional leaders. selection of a successor to the monarchy of the kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. in the interim, a reagent will serve as head of state. hm hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as iroijlaplap. aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the marshalls, part of micronesia in the north pacific ocean and first discovered by european seamen in the 16th century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the marshall islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. today this area is commonly known as wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the united states. in one of the most courageous acts in recent times, irooj hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of eneen-kio atoll for his beloved people. (the account of his acts to establish the kingdom of enenkio as an island state, independent of the governments of the marshalls and the united states, may be researched at the official internet site. on behalf of the government of the kingdom of enenkio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the marshall islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish marshallese domination over eneen-kio atoll. we are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to marshallese ancestry and traditions. in lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming new year are extended to all in peace. news article skip to next file top of page july 14, 1998: communiquã© to correspondents recent articles defaming the government of the kingdom of enenkio have been maliciously published under the guise of a marshall islands government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". we have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the marshall islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. we urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the kingdom of enenkio which are not validated. to that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. for your advice, the following statement was issued by the state secretary of the kingdom in reply: the kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. no claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. we are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of hm king hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of war"" that exists with the united states government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. the kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..."" of the rmi. we are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the united states from the shores of eneen-kio atoll so natural marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. as to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. we say, let the issue be played out in the people's venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. while we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d'ãªtre is clearly mandated in the preamble to the constitution of enenkio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org referencing the news article in the marshall islands journal entitled ""kingdom of enenkio sets up in new zealand,"" of may 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the kingdom's web site. the kingdom of enenkio does not sell passports! if you have evidence to the contrary, our foreign ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. you are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an enenkio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. the published statement, ""the group ...claims to represent iroijlaplap murjel hermios and the atolls of the ratak chain..."", is wholly false. i have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our internet site to refute the statement. the kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the ratak atolls surely are. contrary to their libelous statements, the kingdom of enenkio was not ""created"" by robert moore and he is not a ""honolulu-based attorney."" hm king murjel hermios is the acknowledged hereditary iroijlaplap of the northern ratak atolls and is also first monarch of the kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""enenkio"" [sic] (actually enen-kio or eneen-kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first marshallese name for a marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of bok-ak (taongi) atoll. ""wake"" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered eneen-kio atoll by unknown western society writers. skip to next file top of page may 4, 1997: news release subject: issuance of gold stamps the government of the kingdom of enenkio proudly announces commissioning of its inaugural issue of gold stamps. this announcement, made at the first sunday hawaii stamp, coin and postcard show may 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of gold stamps by the kingdom. stamps are expected to be off the presses by early june 1997. first day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""first day of issue"" by the kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the enenkio philatelic mint mailing list. background - the kingdom was established in march 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in september 1994. however, due to u.s. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the kingdom lingers in ""exile"". several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in europe, south america, usa and elsewhere. a nation in conflict - the land in question, commonly known as wake island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: wake, wilkes and peale. few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll eneen-kio lived in the marshall islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. by way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to ""wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. the united states of america began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by congressional apology to hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the monarchy. ""state of war"" - by way of an official march 1997 declaration sent to top u.s. officials, the kingdom of enenkio has acknowledged that a virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from united states warships. the primary objective of the notice was to request a congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the north pacific ocean by the united states. calls to end u.s. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the united states government. inaugural issue - the gold stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. for that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. however, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. the extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. note: stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. closing comments - the government of the kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the kingdom of enenkio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the pacific region. in doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the federal government of the united states and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. the proceeds from the sale of gold stamps will help fund the restoration of the kingdom and end the conflict in peace. skip to next file top of page march 31, 1997: news release an official document entitled a declaration, was sent march 22 to top executive and legislative officials in the federal government of the united states, including selected cabinet members. the document asserts that: ""a state of war exists over the kingdom of enenkio atoll by way of acts by the federal government of the united states."" this is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. one of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the north pacific ocean by the united states. this latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the kingdom was established in march 1993, each with similar objectives. calls for the u.s. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the king, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the united states. the land in question, commonly called wake island, is comprised of three small islands, wake, wilkes and peale, named by ""western explorers"" for western persons. what of the native discoverers? the crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the northern ratak atolls of marshall islands, the united states seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. historical records reveal that the multiple landings by united states warships, en route to the philippines on war missions, and subsequent congressional action, were the sole basis of the u.s. claim. the motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the east. such a station was never established at wake island. it was destined to become a military installation. however, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the u.s. president by the german consul in the marshall islands and some measure of correspondence followed. but since the u.s. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and germany was defeated in the first world war, the objections fell into oblivion. it is understood from written accounts of oral marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. the u.s. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the caa (predecessor of the faa) allowed pan american airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. clearly, the so-called annexation by the u.s. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. when the u.s. congress apologized for the overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy in 1993 and the u.s. navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the ""natives"" of hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of wake island. the islands of eneen-kio, as the northernmost atoll in the ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the marshall group. while not being used for navy target practice as kaho'olawe was, the use of the islands of eneen-kio atoll and the military mission at wake airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the american public. even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by christian missionaries, natives continued to use eneen-kio, authority to go there being issued by the ratak iroijlaplap (paramount chief). king murjel hermios holds that title today. by way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to wake island. the u.s. cannot produce a title. the hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. upon the basis of events and actions by the united states, the administration of the kingdom of enenkio, by virtue of the declaration, ""yields to the recognition that a state of war"" exists over the island nation. this is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. sovereignty and independence of the kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. the belief is that truth and law is on the side of the kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of u.s. ""ownership"" and occupation. native north americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. in the declaration, demands are made as follows: â» â» ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable accord for the survivors of the said state of war..."". â» â» ""if unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and war reparations to citizens."" â» â» ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and every action of every kind in or on enenkio atoll or within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone..."" â» â» ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the department of the interior â» â» ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than twenty-seven consecutive months and most recently referenced by a certified invoice, no. 97-us-03, dated march 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay."" â» â» that the ""...congress of the united states is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process..."". the government of the kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the kingdom of enenkio atoll as an independent nation under god. it seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the united states and asks them to use their influence accordingly. appeals are being made to the united nations. news article skip to next file top of page february 6, 1995: news release on behalf of his majesty, king murjel hermios, monarch of enenkio atoll, titular head of state, paramount chief (iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the ratak archipelago of pacific ocean islands of the marshall islands, i bid you a warm marshallese greeting -- yokwe! the purpose of this notice is twofold: first, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. as long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the united states remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. summary of events 1993-94: two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the pacific ocean, enenkio, formerly known as wake island. the first was issued on february 25, 1994. it followed two announcements: 1) officials of the us air force at hickam afb, hawaii said in articles published new year's eve and day in both honolulu newspapers that the usaf no longer wanted to maintain wake island airfield and wanted to turn it over to interior department or another military organization by 1 february and abandon it by 1 october, 1994; 2) us army space and strategic defense command of huntsville, alabama issued an environmental impact assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of wake island; part of the ""star wars"" program, i am led to believe. an emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of enenkio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. letters to mr. clinton, members of congress, u.s. army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of enenkio (wake i., peale i., wilkes i.), denounced the army's so-called ""no significant impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the marshall islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. on march 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of enenkio as an independent nation under the authority of his majesty murjel hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to mr. robert moore, appointed minister plenipotentiary. the constitution, succession act and other documents were thereafter drafted. on september 30th, a formal declaration of sovereignty was signed into law by ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the usa founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. it declared the kingdom of enenkio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged his majesty, king murjel hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as head of state and embraced the constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the united nations, un security council, nato, south pacific commission and others. letters of personal appeal were sent to un leaders. a special request for protection and assistance was sent to the un security council. on october 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the united states regarding the illegal january 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of eneen-kio atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international human rights law, un charter terms and terms of the compact of free association with the republic of the marshall islands (public law 99-239; january 14, 1986). having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the u.s. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of us$100 million. the second official press release was issued on november 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the marshall islands journal, a weekly newspaper and islands business pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. request for media response: the thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? how about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the pacific in the name of ""world leadership""? or is it world domination? people of enenkio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: 1. investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by u.s. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of eneen-kio atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (note: these facts and validity of the hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) 2. investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and u.s. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of enenkio . (note: it is my understanding wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing"" of thousands of south vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). 3. reflect on the contrasting history of u.s. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. 4. respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of enenkio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. 5. bring to light u.s. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (note: congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of wake island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) 6. fully disclose to the people of the united states u.s. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to eneen-kio atoll by king hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for human rights protected under international law, united nations charter and conventions and the u.s. compact with the marshall islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (note: u.s. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy the prior year and the return of the hawaiian island, kaho'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by enenkio citizens.) parting shot: what truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the u.s. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. it is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing king hermios have escaped official response from officers of the u.s. federal government. our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked american foreign policy of a century ago. if this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of american attempts at ""fixing up the world"". the title of ownership and inheritance of eneen-kio atoll pre-dates formation of the united states by two centuries or more. it is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. people have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. in conclusion, i reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of u.s. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of god-given individual rights. thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry. top of page november 21, 1994: news release in a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include wake island, site of a u.s. military outpost, his majesty, king murjel hermios, through his legal representative, minister plenipotentiary, robert moore, the u.s. has been given the boot out of wake island. moore served legal notice on top u.s. government officials in october 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. the filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of king hermios) by the gun boat, uss bennington in 1899. the legal document, a commercial affidavit, declaration of fair value and demand for payment, was served under recognized principles of common law and international commercial codes. it details the specifics of king hermios' ancestral rights to wake island, the illegality of the u.s. claim and violations of native laws, international agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the hermios property. it also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. while putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, u.s. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep king hermios and the citizens of enenkio living in compulsory exile. eneen-kio atoll, a name derived from marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including wake. predecessors in interest of king hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to eneen-kio atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years bc. during the colonial invasion of pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. a case in point is in that of the hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the u.s. congress and president bill clinton for the illegal u.s. government overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy. king hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary paramount chief (iroijlaplap) of all the northern atolls of the ratak archipelago of the marshall islands, which terminates to the north, beyond eneen-kio atoll. mr. moore has full authority to act on the king's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted occupation forces in favor of restoring the king's assertion of his native allodial rights. most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the u.s. air force command, 15th logistics group, hickam afb, hawaii. nearly identical articles published in the star bulletin and honolulu advertiser on december 31, 1993 and january 1, 1994 headlined: ""air force willing to give up its hold on wake island"" and stated: ""not much activity there anymore, so the air force wants to give up control"". according to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of king hermios, his predecessors and people. mr. moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of state. the democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its executive council. since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, mr. moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the united states, military officers and members of congress. the following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, king murjel hermios: â» â» formal letters to president clinton and vice-president al gore in february 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. as a military base, wake airfield was ""decommissioned"" more than a decade ago. â» â» in response to the environmental assessment of the proposed theater missile defense rocket launch activities, formal letters of protest sent to the pentagon and u.s. army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from wake island over several years into the waters of the marshall islands, went unanswered. â» â» letters to members of the u.s. congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. â» â» a resolution dated march 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of enenkio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of king murjel hermios. it was likewise ignored. after waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the declared status of enenkio and having heard no objection from the united states, mr. moore assembled the ministers of the executive council. they, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to eneen-kio, formally passed and signed the declaration of sovereignty on september 30, 1994. they also accepted the draft of the constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing his majesty, king murjel hermios as head of state and his family as the first royal family of enenkio . while the king and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of eneen-kio atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the emperor of japan, the emperor of germany, and the king of spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of truth, honor and peace. those principals are embodied in the constitutions of enenkio and of the united states. those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the u.s. congress in public law 99-239 (jan. 14, 1986), signed by president ronald reagan as the compact of free association with the marshall islands and federated states of micronesia. the compact acknowledges superiority of all marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of ownership and use of land. still mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary u.s. military might and the willingness to use it against even the smallest of nations (e.g. grenada, haiti, cuba, hawaii, etc., etc.), mr. moore, other ministers and the citizens of enenkio are determined to peacefully displace the u.s. occupation forces and reassert the jurisdiction of his majesty, king murjel hermios. filing the commercial affidavit document was the first major legal step in a series of actions that could end up in international court of justice in the hague, netherlands. in an effort to garner support for the repatriation of her citizens, the restoration of democratic control of enenkio and to gain international recognition of the innumerable native rights violations against the sovereign and his forebears, the ministers of enenkio have sent documents of notice and request for assistance to the united nations security council, the south pacific commission, similar organizations and to the governments of most other nations of the world. it is hoped that mutual recognition of sovereignty and the establishment of diplomatic ties will invite the willful withdrawal of u.s. troops and relinquishment of their unfounded territorial claims. at the same time, mr. moore, in the service of his majesty, king murjel hermios, wishes to inform all of the people being held at wake island by force of arms or by contract, that asylum will be offered to them. a similar offer is made to all marshallese descendants who desire to become citizens of enenkio. news article: islands business

the facts are simple;- if you need to make a few thousand dollars really fast, then this program i'm going to share with you is the way to do it! it's the fastest, easiest program you will ever do!!! here's something which (i trust) will be of interest to you! please read all of this. this is not something that i would normally look at, except that i read an article in the wall street journal on 6/16/2001 about paypal and, when i came across this concept i knew it would work because, as a member of pay pal, i had already experienced their efficiency and good standing. you can complete this whole process in one hour and you will never forget the day you decided to do so!!! oh! did i say fast? by fast i mean 'the speed of the internet-type fast.' everything is done on the internet by e-mail. need proof? here are just two testimonials from individuals who decided to invest nothing more than a little of their time. testimonials from: tony stevens, vandenberg afb, ca: hey! i got your e-mail! you rock! i sent it to all of our frat brothers.....and while i haven't seen my $20 grand yet, i'm up to $8,285. hook me up when you run this program again........ mary gathers, columbia, sc: hey cuz! this is mary. i only have one thing to say to you... oh my god! i sent 20 e-mail's out like you said and went on vacation. when i got back, my account was up to over $12,000! i owe you! getting started. if you're not already a user, the very first thing you need to do is go to paypal and sign up. it takes two minutes and paypal will deposit $5.00 in your account. that makes this program free! here's the link: https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com be sure to sign up for a premier (free) account! or you'll be limited to $100 dollars only!!! you will make much more than this!!! then...... e-mail $5.00 from your paypal account ($5.00 free) to the first name on the list (no.1) along with a little note like ""please add me to your mailing list."" be prepared to get excited.... you won't be disappointed!!! don't laugh! try this while you wait for the others to start working. one hour of work to get started - no mailing lists. no printing, copying or waiting and the concept is 100% legal (refer to us postal and lottery laws, title 18, section 1302 and 1341, or title 18, section 3005 in the us code, also in the code of federal regulations, volume 16, sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received). here's how it works. unlike many other programs, this three level program is more realistic and much, much faster. because it is so easy, the response rate is very high, very fast-internet e-mail fast-and you will see results in just two weeks or less! just in time for next months bills! you need only mail out 20 copies (not 200 or more as in other programs). ideally, you should send them to people who send their programs to you or to personal contacts who are already working on the web, because they know these programs work and they are already believers in the system! besides, this program is much, much faster and has a higher response rate! even if you are already in another program, stay with it, but do yourself a favor and do this one as well. start right now! it's simple and will only cost $5.00 max. it will pay off long before others even begin to receive letters! just give one person a $5.00 gift (remember though, this $5.00 is the $5.00 you get when you sign up for your new paypal account). that's all! if you already have a paypal account and do not receive the $5.00, feel free to donate a $5.00 gift to the person in the no.1 spot and add your name on the list at no.3 position having moved up the remaining two. follow the simple instructions and in two weeks you will have $20,000 in your bank account! because of the virtually zero investment, speed and high profit potential, this program has a very high response rate! all from just one $5.00 transaction that you get from paypal!!! follow these simple instructions: e-mail the $5.00 from your paypal account to the first name on the list (no.1) along with a note saying ""subscribe me to your mailing list"". only the first person on the list gets your name and $5.00 gift. edit the list, removing the first (no.1) name from the list. move the other two names up and add your name. don't try to add your name in the first place in order to earn money fast! if you do that, you will only reach people you send e- mail to then your name will be immediately removed from the no.1 place and you can't reach more people! but if you add your name on the no.3 place, there will be tons of people receiving e-mail's later and when your name is no.1!!! note: do not forget to replace the paypal referring url in the body of the letter with your own paypal referring url. send out 20 copies (minimum) of this letter. also note: by sending this letter and the payment via e-mail, the response time is much faster... electronic transfer internet fast! consider this! millions of people surf the internet everyday, all day, all over the world! here are the 3 people to start with. sign up, send $5.00 to the first person, move the other two up to nos 1 & 2 respectively and add your own e-mail address at no.3. be sure to use your email address that is associated with your paypal account. ************************************* 1. csreddy3@rediffmail.com 2. tomk4@prodigy.net 3. larryspaypal@yahoo.com ************************************* there are fifty thousand new people who get on the internet every month! an excellent source ofemail addresses is the people who send you offers by email. the source is unlimited! it boggles my mind to think of all the possibilities! mail, or should i say 'e-mail', your letter and payment today! it's so easy. one hour of your time, that's it! to send your letter by e-mail, copy this entire page and paste it in the message of your e-mail. to do this: 1. go in your toolbar to ""edit"" and ""select all"" 2. go in your toolbar to ""edit"" and select ""copy"" 3. start (compose) a new e-mail message (make sure it's plain text so everyone can view it!) 4. fill in your address and subject box 5. go to ""edit"" and ""paste"" (then you can format it anyway you want!) now you can edit the addresses with ease. delete the top name, adding your name and address to the bottom of the list, then simply changing the numbers. remember, your name goes on the bottom and the other 2 names move up. but do not forget to send $5.00 via paypal (along with your note) to the position #1 - top e-mail address before deleting it! note: be sure to replace the paypal referring url in this e-mail of the letter with your own paypal referring url; https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com there's nothing more to do. when your name reaches the first position in a few days, it will be your turn to collect your money! the money will be sent to you by 2,000 to 4,000 people like yourself, who are willing to invest one hour to receive $20,000 in cash! that's all! there will be a total of $20,000 in $5.00 bills in your mailbox (account) in two weeks. $20,000 for one hour's work! this is real money that you can spend on anything you wish! just deposit it to your own bank account or spend it directly from your paypal account!!! it's just that easy!!! i think it's worth it, don't you? go ahead--- try it!!! even if you make just 3 or 4 thousand, wouldn't that be nice? if you try it, it will pay! can you do it again? of course you can--- this plan is structured for everyone to send only 20 letters each. however, you are certainly not limited to 20. mail out as many as you want. every 20 letters you send has a return of $20,000 or more. if you can e-mail forty, sixty, eighty, or whatever, go for it! the more you put into it the more you get out of it! each time you run this program, just follow steps 1 through 3 and everyone on your gift list benefits! simple enough? you bet it is! besides, there are no mailing lists to buy (and wait for), and trips to the printer or copier, and you can do it again and again with your regular groups or gift givers, or start up a new group. be sure and pay the first person on the list. this is proof that you paid to get put on the list which is the service rendered to make all this legal!!!

================================================== be an internet millionaire like others within a year!!! before you say ''bull'', please read the following. this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can ""follow the simple instruction"" they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''. due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this program has attained, it is currently working better than ever. this is what one had to say: '' thanks to this profitable opportunity"". i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it. i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. to my astonishment, i received a total $ 610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. pam hedland, fort lee, new jersey. ================================================== another said: ""this program has been around for a long time but i never believed in it. but one day when i received this again in the mail i decided to gamble my $25 on it. i followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. first month i only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of $290,000.00. so far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, i have made over $710,000.00 and i am playing it again. the key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything.'' more testimonials later but first: =========== print this now for your future reference ==== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ if you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...then read it again and again !!! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ follow the simple instruction below and your financial dreams will come true, guaranteed! instructions: =====order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== for each report, send $5 cash, the name & number of the report you are ordering and your e-mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report. make sure your return address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems. ===when you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports! === you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. your total cost $5 x 5 = $25.00. within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer. important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on the majority of your profits. once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work !!! people have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. but it does not work this way. believe us, some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed. because if you do, it will not work for you. remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! this is a legitimate business. you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time. 1. after you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and remove the name & address of the person in report # 5. this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2. move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5. 3. move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4. 4. move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3. 5. move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2 6. insert your name & address in the report # 1 position. please make sure you copy every name & address accurately! this is critical to your success. ================================================== **** take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. do not make any other changes. save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. to assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going: method # 1: by sending bulk e-mail legally ================================================== let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%). also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. with a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. that's=100 people responded and ordered report # 2. those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3. those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. the 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for report # 4. those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for report # 5. that's 100,000 orders times $5 each = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars). your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... grand total=$555,550.00 numbers do not lie. get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money! ================================================== remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5,000 you mailed to. dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming on line every day. believe me, many people will do just that, and more! method # 2: by placing free ads on the internet ================================================== advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise. placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method #2 as you go along. for every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. that's it. always provide same day service on all orders. this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report. ===========available reports ==================== the reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". it is simply about time. time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you. order each report by its number & name only. notes: always send $5 cash (u.s. currency) for each report. checks not accepted. make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. on one of those sheets of paper, write the number & the name of the report you are ordering, your e-mail address and your name and postal address. place your order for these reports now: ================================================== report# 1: the insider's guide to advertising for free on the net order report #1 from dave dryden p.o. box 454 drexel hill pa. 19026 usa _______________________________________________________ report # 2: the insider's guide to sending bulk email on the net order report # 2 from: mc enterprise 3140 so. peoria # 139 aurora co. 80014 - 3155 usa _________________________________________________________________ report # 3: secret to multilevel marketing on the net order report # 3 from: jay longfield 5453 so. olive st. greenwood village co. 80111 usa ___________________________________________________________________ report # 4: how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net order report # 5 from: k. ryl 2134 so. eagle ct. aurora co. 80014 usa _______________________________________________________ report #5: how to send out one million emails for free order report # 5 from: alex bukin 398 main street nashua nh. 03060 usa ________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ your success guidelines $$$$$$$$$$$ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: === if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === after you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2. if you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. **once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2, you can relax, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember: every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report. you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you. if you want to generate more income send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again. there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business !!! ================================================= following is a note from the originator of this program: you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with no risk and just a little bit of effort. you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. follow the program exactly as instructed. do not change it in any way. it works exceedingly well as it is now. remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report #1 and moved others to #2 ....# 5 as instructed above. one of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. so my friend, i have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. it is up to you now ! =============more testimonials=============== '' my name is mitchell. my wife, jody and i live in chicago. i am an accountant with a major u.s. corporation and i make pretty good money. when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving ''junk mail''. i made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. i ''knew'' it wouldn't work. jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. i made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''i told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. well, the laugh was on me! within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash! i was shocked. i have joined jody in her ''hobby''. mitchell wolf c.p.a., chicago, illinois ================================================= '' not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. but conservative as i am, i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' i was surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. i made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. the nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. there simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''. dan sondstrom, alberta, canada ================================================= '' i had received this program before. i deleted it, but later i wondered if i should have given it a try. of course, i had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so i had to wait until i was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... i did not delete this one! i made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''. susan de suza, new york, n.y. ================================================= '' it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. i followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. my first month i made $ 20, 560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ 362,840.00. life is beautiful, thanks to internet''. fred dellaca, westport, new zealand ================================================= order your reports today and get started on your road to financial freedom ! ================================================= if you have any questions of the legality of this program, contact the office of associate director for marketing practices, federal trade commission, bureau of consumer protection, and washington, d.c. ================================================= one time mailing, no need to remove ================================================= 6208nxii1-295ukof6l17",1

262,262,"hi, i'm a college dropout. i work about two hours a day. i'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and i make over $250,000 a year. are you curious yet? in a minute i'm going to tell you my secret, it's the dirty little secret of the internet ... you've probably heard stories about people making whopping huge money online, but you thought they were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or boy-geniuses. well, grasshopper, think again ... it's people like you and me that are making the real money. yep, people like you and me! ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time entrepreneurs are getting richer while the fortune 500 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers. today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use the web to achieve complete financial freedom with no investment and very little work. how? by learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created - it's called bulk email. if you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then you know what bulk email is. i bet you can't click on delete fast enough for most of those ads, right? you might not want their product, but remember that thousands of other folks probably do. bulk email is a percentage game - every bulker who contacts you makes a six figure income on the internet. i guarantee it. now let's go back to math 101 and review some numbers ... if you sell on ebay, you pay anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one auction. how many people see your ad? maybe a couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand over a period of days. using bulk email, you can send your ad to more than a million people a day at virtually no cost. whether your send 100,000 emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same. zero! stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when hardly anyone sees your ad! imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of $20.00 on each sale. if you send an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person in a thousand actually places an order, then you just generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours of work. it's that simple ... all you have to do is convince one person out of a thousand to buy your stuff and you're filthy rich. the best thing is that anyone can do it. doesn't matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old executive working from an office building in new york city. anyone, and i repeat anyone, can start bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs. all it takes is a few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some basic familiarity with the internet. i quit college when i was 19 to capitalize on the ""dot com"" mania, and i've never looked back. i started with no money, no product to sell, and only the most rudimentary computer skills. i saw an opportunity and i seized it. a few years later, i bought my own home - with cash. you don't need any money. you don't need a product. you don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience whatsoever is required. if you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that you'd jump right on it. it would be a dream come true. so what are you waiting for?! i'm going to ask you four simple questions. if you answer yes to all of them, then i can almost promise that you will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year. here goes ... do you have basic experience with the web? do you have a computer and an internet connection? do you have a few hours each day of free time? do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards complete financial freedom? if you answer yes to these questions, you could be making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your home. kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats the 9-5 daily grind! all you need is ambition and commitment. this is no ""get rich quick scheme"". you have to work to make big bucks, but anyone - and i mean anyone - can do it. you're probably wondering if it's hard to get started. don't worry, it's not! i will show you step-by-step how to start your first email campaign and how to build a booming online business. you'll be generating orders - and making money - in less than seven days. okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell? no problem!! i'll show you where to find hot products that sell like craaaaaazy! most people delay starting an internet business because they have nothing to sell, but i'm removing that hurdle right now. after reading the bulkbook, you can build your complete product line in less than two hours! there is no excuse not to get started! i will get you up-and-running within seven days. in fact ... i personally guarantee that you will start your own bulk email campaign less than a week after reading the bulkbook! i'll give you a toll-free phone number to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; where else will you find that level of service?! i will also include a step-by-step guide to starting your very first email campaign called ""seven days to bulk email success"". this seperate guide contains a daily routine for you to follow with specific, exact instructions on how to get started. on day one, for example, i teach you where to find a product to sell. the next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing list. on the seventh day, you just click send! your very first campaign is ready to go. as a special bonus, you'll recieve a free copy of our stealth mass mailer, a very powerful bulk email program which retails for $49.99! i'll even include 7 million email addresses absolutely free if you order now! stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and never will! if you are serious about making money on the internet, bulk email is your only option. what are you waiting for?

271,271,"ilug , from;mr.michael kamah and family, johannesburg,south africa. my dear , good day.this very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.but it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and i quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.i got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes. my name is mr.michael kamah, the second son of mr.smith kamah, of beitbridge zimbabwe.at the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,mr.robert g.mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.my father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .he publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by mr.robert mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.that not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and ! confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.i therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the republic of south africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood. during my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of eight million and six hundred thousand united states dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a finance and security company in the republic of togo for a cash and carry diamond and gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.in view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,i therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of africa finally,to the europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present mugabe's! regime.my mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit. now this is what i actually want you to do for me; 1. i want you to be presented to the finance and security company as the person i contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the republic of togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office. 2. to finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. please,i hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.and also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,i emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request. best regards, mr.michael kamah and family. -- irish linux users' group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. list maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie",1

============================================ **** take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. do not make any other changes. save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. to assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going: method # 1: by sending bulk e-mail legally ============================================ let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. with a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. that's=100 people responded and ordered report # 2. those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3. those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. the 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for report #4. those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for report # 5. that's 100,000 orders times $5 each=$500,000.00 (half million). your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 grand total=$555,550.00 numbers do not lie. get a pencil & paper and figure it out! the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money! ============================================ remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5,000 you mailed to. dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting. believe me, many people will do just that, and more! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet ============================================ advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise. placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and method # 2 as you go along. for every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. that's it. always provide same day service on all orders. this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report. =========== available reports ============ order each report by its number & name only. notes: always send $5 cash (u.s. currency) for each report. checks not accepted. make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. on one of those sheets of paper, write the number & the name of the report you are ordering, your e-mail address and your name and postal address. place your order for these reports now : ============================================ report # 1: ""the insider's guide to advertising for free on the net"" order report #1 from: b.o.n.e.y cap suite# 909 -10175-114th street edmonton, alberta,t5k 2l4 canada __________________________________________________ report # 2: ""the insider's guide to sending bulk e-mail on the net"" order report # 2 from: ventures 2001 box 445 station main edmonton.alberta,canada t5j 2k1 _________________________________________________ report # 3: ""secret to multilevel marketing on the net"" order report # 3 from : b. g mailers box 1161 camrose, alberta, canada t4v 1x1 __________________________________________________ report # 4: ""how to become a millionaire utilizing mlm & the net"" order report # 4 from: p.u.g. 7919-118th street n.delta, bc , v4c6g9, canada __________________________________________________ report #5: ""how to safely send two million emails at virtually no cost"" order report # 5 from: k.l.g venture suite# 909-10175-114th street,edmonton ,alberta, t5k 2l4 canada _________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ your success guidelines $$$$$$$$$$$ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: === if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === after you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2. if you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. === once you have received 100 or more orders for report #2, you can relax, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember: every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report. you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you. if you want to generate more income send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again. there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business !!! ============================================ following is a note from the originator of this program: you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with no risk and just a little bit of effort. you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. follow the program exactly as instructed. do not change it in any way. it works exceedingly well as it is now. remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed above. one of the |people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. remember though, the more you send out the more potential customer you will reach. so my friend, i have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. it is up to you now ! ======== more testimonials ============ ""my name is mitchell. my wife, jody and i live in chicago. i am an accountant with a major u.s. corporation and i make pretty good money. when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving ''junk mail''. i made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. i ''knew'' it wouldn't work. jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. i made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''i told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. well, the laugh was on me! within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! i was shocked. i have joined jody in her ''hobby''. mitchell wolf c.p.a., chicago, illinois ========================================== ''not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. but conservative that i am, i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''.

306,306,"in 1957, a monastery in thailand was being relocated and a group of monks was put in charge of moving a giant clay buddha. in the midst of the move one of the monks noticed a crack in the buddha. concerned about damaging the idol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task. when night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. he shined his flashlight over the entire buddha. when he reached the crack he saw something reflected back at him. the monk, his curiosity aroused, got a hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay buddha. as he knocked off piece after piece of clay, the buddha got brighter and brighter. after hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before him a huge solid-gold buddha. many historians believe the buddha had been covered with clay by thai monks several hundred years earlier before an attack by the burmese army. they covered the buddha to keep it from being stolen. in the attack all the monks were killed, so it wasn't until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant statue, that the great treasure was discovered. like the buddha, our outer shell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. we human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. all we need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our outer shell, piece by piece. could you be sitting on your own gold mine? did you know the average american can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? then, why don't they? it's simple. they haven't been taught that they could. they are taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money work for them. they pay too much in taxes. they are wasting money every month and don't even realize it. in short, they are financially unhealthy. get a financial checkup and a free video on how to become ""financially fit for life"" and discover the gold within your current income. get your free 3-point checkup and video now! http://216.190.209.155/finfit/checkup.html ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- to unsubscribe, email removeme@speededelivery.com with the subject ""remove"". speededelivery . jordan commons tower 9350 south 150 east sandy, ut 84070 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------",1

43%<br> are women and 36% are part time</font> <font color=""#000000""> .<br> <br> one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are<br> not under any kind of time frame. if you decide to take off<br> for a month on vacation then go. the judgments you are<br> working on will be there when you return. the judgments<br> are still in force, they do not disappear.<br> <br> the way we train you is non-confrontational. you use your<br> computer and telephone to do most of the processing. you<br> never confront the debtor. the debtor doesn't know who you<br> are. you are not a collection agency.<br> <br> simply stated the steps to successful money processing<br> are as follows:<br> <br> mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals<br> with money judgments. (we train you how to find out who<br> to write to)<br> <br> 8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you<br> and ask for your help. they call you, you don't call them<br> unless you want to.<br> <br> you send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to<br> sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and<br> 50% to them. this applies no matter if the judgment is for<br> $2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.<br> <br> you then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor<br> and their assets. we offer over 120 powerful reports to<br> assist you. they range from credit reports from all three<br> credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment<br> locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.<br> the prices of our reports are very low. typically 1/2 to<br> 1/3 of what other firms charge. for example we charge<br> $6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other<br> companies charge $25.00.<br> <br> once you find the debtor and their assets you file<br> garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.<br> (standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the<br> course)<br> <br> when you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to<br> the original judgment holder.<br> <br> once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of<br> judgment to the court.

344,344,"socijalisticka partija srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa milomirem minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke slobodana milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je socijalisticka partija srbije, pa zvao se on i slobodan milosevic''. socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici slobodana milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu slobodana milosevica u hagu, od politickog zivota u srbiji, pripisujuci milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje s. milosevica, ,,sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste socijalisticku partiju srbije. iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. branislav ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova sps, danas rukovodstvo sps koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije. ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije slobodan milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija rukovodstvo i glavni odbor te stranke. medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva. procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da bata zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova. clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, slobodanu milosevicu. po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika slobodana milosevica. mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se sps svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori dejana stjepanovica i igora raicevica, i po neki milinka isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika sps. obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti. stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. branko ruzic i dejan backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela slobodana milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava. cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista beograda, ana djurovic udala za branka ruzica, predsednika mladih socijalista srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo dejna backovia, svog potpredsednika. backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova io go sps-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz saveta mladih. sve u svemu, mladi u sps se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u sad. sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima. pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im bata prodje losije od seselja koga je predsednik slobodan milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat? _______________________________________________________________________ powered by list builder to unsubscribe follow the link: http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=90b245569c3b981a&m=4",1

""it seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to make changes,"" geist said. ""to me that's not a particularly convincing argument. if there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, make that case."" geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new powers) are needed. i don't know that there have been a significant number of cases where police have run into problems."" probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is compelling internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention orders. the united states has a similar requirement, called the communications assistance for law enforcement act <http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it applies only to pre-internet telecommunications companies. ""it is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national security agencies,"" according to the proposal. companies would be responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment. sarah andrews, an analyst at the electronic privacy information center <http://www.epic.org/> (epic) who specializes in international law, says the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""their proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not just internet providers,"" andrews said. ""the cybercrime treaty deals only with computer data."" epic opposes <http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and does not adequately respect privacy rights. another section of the proposal says the canadian association of chiefs of police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with personal information about all canadian internet users. ""the implementation of such a database would presuppose that service providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" the draft says. gus hosein, a visiting fellow at the london school of economics and an activist with privacy international, calls the database ""a dumb idea."" ""immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the internet anonymously,"" hosein said. a representative for george radwanski <http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, canada's privacy commissioner, said the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on the paper as it stands."" comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca <mailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca> no later than nov. 15.",0

174,174,"i did something crudely along those lines for vms vax maybe 13 years ago; there is at least one product that does it for pc though i don't recall its name. it is also handy for cases where you have a cd image of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is not graceful) readonly storage. it is also more or less necessary if you want to work with worm file structures, which are older still. there have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the early 1980s if not before. a generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. the written information must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you wrote to the storage. a device level implementation is however perfectly adequate. it does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed and what should not. if you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition) must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes, or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (ntfs lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. i have not tried it on extf3 or reiser.) btw, think about your mention of raid and consider the complexity of writing to raid4 or raid5... i would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense to use raid, save for shadowing and possibly striping. those at least do not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher raid levels have, and there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk may hold 200 gigs and up. why not dedicate another whole disk to fault recovery and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of raid? glenn everhart -----original message----- from: bmord@icon-nicholson.com [mailto:bmord@icon-nicholson.com] sent: tuesday, september 03, 2002 3:04 pm to: webappsec securityfocus.com; secprog securityfocus subject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from attacks hi, i was inspired by a mode of operation supported by vmware. you can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. that base image is never altered by a vm instance. instead, each vm instance writes changes to its own ""redo"" log. future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine. this is described here (thanks to duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list) http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks, even before those attacks have been discovered? here is what i imagine. the physical architectures of most production client/server systems are layered. for example, your basic web application might have a web server running apache, connected to an application server running some j2ee or .net business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. the only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server, and even here you often put the static rdbms software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. it is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next. other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot. when someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that shouldn't be changed. e.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in iis or apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. but what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or ""redo"" partition? and then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted? the downtime involved for each machine would be minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from backup. in a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible. this base/redo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware raid, allowing for greater performance, reliability, and hack resistance. this concept could also be applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions (except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.) does anyone do this already? or is this a new concept? or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that i don't yet know? i use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems. it would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and non-volatile disk images. it would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or no) downtime. thanks for any opinions, ben ********************************************************************** this transmission may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or exempt from disclosure under applicable law. if you are not the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any disclosure, copying, distribution, or use of the information contained herein (including any reliance thereon) is strictly prohibited. if you received this transmission in error, please immediately contact the sender and destroy the material in its entirety, whether in electronic or hard copy format. thank you **********************************************************************",0

you don't think this has anything to do with .net being a competitor to java do you? or that ms has basically copied java (with some additional features) and called it c#? isn't that alone an indication that they actually do think that a vm is the right way to go for most high level applications?

179,179,"...an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized, over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the british singles scene,"" glad to see american culture is making it's way into the british bars too :) god bless us uncivilized bastards, every one. still, definately something not right about the below. people are now cheaper then a decent laptop? (ok, so we knew that already) ------------- selling wedded bliss big business in thailand thu aug 29,10:19 am et by andrew marshall bangkok, thailand (reuters) - english dentist ken moylan came to thailand looking for a wife. it took two hours to find her. ""the first day i went out with wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all my clothes up and tidied the room. i thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""i knew then there was something special."" moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet -- and marry -- thai women. he lives in england now with 28-year-old wan, who is expecting their first child. critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the west that often turn sour. but moylan says he has no regrets about coming to thailand in search of a wife. ""i got to thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. i'd met wan,"" he said. ""i knew i found her attractive. i could tell straight away that she was very caring."" moylan spent a week in thailand, and after returning to england kept in touch with wan by phone and mail. six months later she came to england and the couple married. mr. marriage lawrence lynch, 49, runs thai professional introduction services, the agency moylan used to meet his wife. lynch, who calls himself ""mr. marriage,"" started the company after also marrying a thai woman through an introduction agency. since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages. ""in the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""to the best of my knowledge, they have all been successful."" male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount. clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of thai women looking for a husband. if they like what they see they come to bangkok. clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in lynch's office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and language problems. ""we find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,"" lynch said. ""but once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax."" after the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know each other better. within two weeks of arrival, lynch says, almost every client has found a potential wife. ""at the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. in most cases, marriage follows, usually within the next year. roongthip kamchat, managing director of thai no. 1 connections, a bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less than 10 percent have broken up. roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just arrived in bangkok looking for a wife. ""sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""and sometimes they are very impatient and say 'give me a lady, i want to get married now.' i say: 'calm down, ok, we'll talk.""' but if men are really in a hurry, roongthip says, she can find them a wife and get them married within a week. lynch says clients he has found wives for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic stress disorder. why? similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. critics say they thrive on the neediness of lonely western men who are unable to form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the west. but moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is no reason to object. ""if you talk about people who are needy, i think everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, i need wan,"" he said. ""thai women are dissatisfied with life in thailand. i think there's no secret there. they are looking for a better life. i don't have a problem with that. in return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to their future husband."" lynch says men are dissatisfied with western women too, and that is why they choose to use his agency. his brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized, over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the british singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are not ""god's gift to women."" roongthip said many western men found it difficult to meet women in their own countries -- and found thai women attractive. ""they don't know how to meet women. even if they go to pubs or discotheques or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them? impossible,"" she said. ""many thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. they are good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. different from ladies from other countries."" although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap, the agencies say this is not a problem. they say language problems are also not a major obstacle. ""thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having a husband who is significantly older,"" lynch said. ""when i met my wife she couldn't speak a word of english. we muddled along with a phonetic dictionary. the ladies are very keen to learn english and they pick it up very quickly."" many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move to the west. ""we have kitchens, we have study classes,"" roongthip said. ""we teach them how to eat, and when to make tea."" pitfalls but not all dreams come true. ""bee"" is a 26-year-old thai woman who went to switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. now she is back in bangkok, sad and angry. ""he had no friends, and i was so lonely,"" she said. ""i tried to make him happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. he never spoke to me."" bee came back to bangkok earlier this year. ""i thought i would be happy there,"" she said. ""but it was the worst time of my life."" lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure unsuitable candidates are weeded out. ""we are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""we will not take on all comers."" moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the arrangement can work. wan's sister has just signed up with lynch's company, looking for a foreign husband. ""perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. i'm sure there are,"" moylan said. ""but in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.""",0

""it looked at me calmly before moving on."" the bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know news shopper had been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news of the sighting. his wife, karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images of the large cat prowling through their garden. she said: ""i feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat i'd hate for it to get hurt."" mr gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at ""nothing"" in the garden but barked that morning. he warned: ""i don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they might jump you."" sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the plumstead common and shooters hill as well at the bexley area. if you have seen the big cat, call news shopper on 01689 885712. 12:27 tuesday 8th october 2002 _________________________________________________________________ send and receive hotmail on your mobile device: http://mobile.msn.com ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~--> sell a home for top $ http://us.click.yahoo.com/rrpzmc/jtmeaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-> to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/",0

[given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school, like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of *those* on the forbes 400 as well as time goes on. if we ever get around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.] the *next* category on the forbes 400 list is someone with a ""terminal"" professional degree, like an mba, phd, md, etc., from the best school possible. why? because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into harvard, for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. don't take my word for it, ask their admissions office. look at the admissions stats over the years for proof. meritocracy, american style, was *invented* at the ivy league after world war ii. even stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course, chicago taught them all how, right? :-). practically *nobody* who goes to a top-20 american institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days. unless, of course, their parents, who couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so. and their kids *still* had to get the grades, and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in. the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal"" degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is* smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow. btw, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that i'm using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. you were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *i* went to missouri, and *i* don't have a degree in anything actually useful, much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *i*'m broker than anyone on this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. the facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*. there are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and economics is not a zero-sum game. the cost of anything, including ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case, intelligence and effort. [i will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you, apparently.] btw, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country, *including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes, all those smart people in the forbes 400 would have *more* money, and there would be *more* self-made people on that list. in addition, most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have *much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. finally, practically all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not. that efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in the people's republics of berkeley or cambridge. it means more and better stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd know about it by now. in economic terms, it's also called an increase in general welfare, and, no, virginia, i'm not talking about extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as santa claus come election time... in short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise. to believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time marx wrote capital and the manifesto -- romantic nonsense. cheers, rah -----begin pgp signature----- version: pgp 7.5 iqa/awubpy511cpxh8jf3ohaeqlasgcfzhsqmsvuy6gqj5wgl52dwzkpihmanrur yyboc+icylp5tlkl58jpwefu =z877 -----end pgp signature----- -- ----------------- r. a. hettinga <mailto: rah@ibuc.com> the internet bearer underwriting corporation <http://www.ibuc.com/> 44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa ""... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, [predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to experience."" -- edward gibbon, 'decline and fall of the roman empire'",0

236,236,"i think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports all python platforms and not just the l|unix crowd is desirable. mac and pc users are more apt to be using a commercial mua that's unlikely to offer hooking ability (at least not easily). as mentioned elsewhere, even l|unix users may find an mua solution easier to use then getting it added to their mta. (sysops make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).) my notion of a solution for windows/outlook has been, as guido described, a client-server. client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, i'm only going to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). the mua accesses this ""ethunk"" as a server to obtain all the ham. spam is retained in the ethunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter) and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next mua fetch. ethunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but i am not clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme. outbound mail would use a direct path from the mua to the mta. hopefully all muas can split the host fetch/send url's imo, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. if this is available, the ""simple viewer"" could be enhanced to support viewing via folders and (at least for me) the outlook nightmare is over - i would use this as my only mua.

[given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school, like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of *those* on the forbes 400 as well as time goes on. if we ever get around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.] the *next* category on the forbes 400 list is someone with a ""terminal"" professional degree, like an mba, phd, md, etc., from the best school possible. why? because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into harvard, for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. don't take my word for it, ask their admissions office. look at the admissions stats over the years for proof. meritocracy, american style, was *invented* at the ivy league after world war ii. even stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course, chicago taught them all how, right? :-). practically *nobody* who goes to a top-20 american institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days. unless, of course, their parents, who couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so. and their kids *still* had to get the grades, and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in. the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal"" degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is* smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow. btw, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that i'm using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. you were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *i* went to missouri, and *i* don't have a degree in anything actually useful, much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *i*'m broker than anyone on this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. the facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*. there are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and economics is not a zero-sum game. the cost of anything, including ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case, intelligence and effort. [i will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you, apparently.] btw, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country, *including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes, all those smart people in the forbes 400 would have *more* money, and there would be *more* self-made people on that list. in addition, most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have *much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. finally, practically all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not. that efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in the people's republics of berkeley or cambridge. it means more and better stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd know about it by now. in economic terms, it's also called an increase in general welfare, and, no, virginia, i'm not talking about extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as santa claus come election time... in short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise. to believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time marx wrote capital and the manifesto -- romantic nonsense. cheers, rah -----begin pgp signature----- version: pgp 7.5 iqa/awubpy511cpxh8jf3ohaeqlasgcfzhsqmsvuy6gqj5wgl52dwzkpihmanrur yyboc+icylp5tlkl58jpwefu =z877 -----end pgp signature----- -- ----------------- r. a. hettinga <mailto: rah@ibuc.com> the internet bearer underwriting corporation <http://www.ibuc.com/> 44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa ""... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, [predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to experience."" -- edward gibbon, 'decline and fall of the roman empire'",0

i hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that americans see coming from europe doesn't actually represent the views of europeans. for various reasons i'm not exactly a cheerleader for the us government, but the premises of the argument against them here are lame. > my personal point is that few americans (percentage of overall population) > have ever left their country, while even german construction workers > regularly spend their holidays in spain. so i'm not surprised that > paranoia is growing. i'm betting you are underestimating the actual percentage. the vast majority of people i know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the country at one time or another. and i doubt europeans have traveled anywhere near as much in the western hemisphere as americans have. despite the best efforts of france, europe is *still* not the center of the universe. i'll throw you a bone though: most americans do consider europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it. but from the perspective of an american, how could you not look at it this way? the impact of europe on america has diminished greatly over the years. i love the smell of euro-chauvinism in the morning. first, you assume that the north american continent is ethnically and culturally homogenous. anybody that has actually traveled throughout north america knows this isn't true; there are more than five major and very distinct cultures and societies in the us alone, never mind the hundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are truly foreign. apparently europeans confuse speaking the same language with having the same culture. that would be like saying mexico is culturally identical to spain because they nominally speak the same language. a wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with your average person living in san francisco, despite speaking the same language and nominally living in the same country. if i want to visit a wildly different culture for the holidays, i'll go to oakland, new orleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where i live than some countries i've traveled to. and a lot of these places are farther from where i live than spain is from germany. second, the state i live in is the size of germany. when i travel to a neighboring state (which i do regularly), how is this not equivalent? in fact, i probably travel much farther for the holidays than your german construction workers. if you look at the eu as a single country, only then does your analogy become comparable. what kind of ridiculous superiority do europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries? in truth, i find europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the us. there are a lot of cultural similarities across the eu with relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very similar to the us. the only real difference is that europeans have dozens of different languages, which is hardly something i would call an advantage. although there are a couple parts of the us where i can't understand a word they are saying either. -james rogers jamesr@best.com",0

254,254,"http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/story/0,2763,806744,00.html evangelicals' threat to new archbishop direct action threat over liberal views on sexuality stephen bates, religious affairs correspondent tuesday october 8, 2002 the guardian evangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust rowan williams, the incoming archbishop of canterbury, before he even takes up his post, by threatening to take ""direct action"" against him. the council of the church society, the church of england's oldest evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called reform, which is also opposed to dr williams, in calling on him to recant his supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down. following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his appointment and called on all anglicans to spurn him. the move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement. some evangelicals object to dr williams's acknowledgement that he has ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. the new archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the church. nevertheless, the society said: ""it is clear that he prefers his private judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the common mind of the church. as such he can only be a focus of disunity. ""the council... called upon loyal anglicans to pray specifically that rowan williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand down,"" it said. the society claimed to have drawn up an ""action plan,"" including calling on bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide anglican communion, of which archbishops of canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from dr williams's doctrinal and ethical position. it promised it would be ""taking steps towards appropriate direct action"". it added that dr williams remained on the editorial board of a journal called theology and sexuality which, six months ago, published articles allegedly commending homosexual behaviour. despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the church. dr williams, currently archbishop of wales, was chosen by the crown appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the queen. he is due to succeed george carey, who retires this month, and will be formally enthroned at canterbury cathedral in february. asked what form direct action might take, the rev george curry, the society's chairman, said: ""watch this space."" presumably it could involve a small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where dr williams is present. church of england bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the absence of a robust rebuttal. a letter by senior theologians in today's guardian, however, repudiates the evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical teaching. on the bbc's thought for the day yesterday, angela tilby, vice-principal of westcott house, cambridge, accused dr williams's opponents of presumption and blackmail. ""it is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. it is attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,"" she said. last week, dr williams said he was deeply saddened. ""matters of sexuality should not have the priority or centrality that reform and the church society have tried to give them. the archbishop cannot withdraw his appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under god."" ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~--> sell a home with ease! http://us.click.yahoo.com/srpzmc/ktmeaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-> to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/",0

270,270,"i have some patches that seem to fix/avoid this problem now. (it is amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for ups's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and its battery supply...) first, i put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was occurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a sequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of such things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback. this one solves the initial problem: --- mh.tcl.was thu aug 22 21:15:06 2002 +++ mh.tcl wed aug 28 12:39:11 2002 @@ -487,6 +487,10 @@ set seq {} set rseq {} foreach range [split [string trim $sequence]] { + if ![regexp {^[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?$} $range] { + # just ignore anything bogus + continue; + } set parts [split [string trim $range] -] if {[llength $parts] == 1} { lappend seq $parts that is amending proc mhseqexpand which is where the error was occurring before (the code assumes that $range is either nnn or nnn-mmm so we should probably make sure that's true - issue an error instead of just ""continue"" if you like, but i don't think an error is needed). but that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place, by typing ""nnn-"" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this, i thought i should think more about brent's suggestion. but rather than have the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it would have to know what is to be valid, i decided that the right thing to do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so i just stuck a ""catch"" around the msgshow that is processing the nonsense that the user has typed. this way, any later expansion to what msgshow treats as legal (maybe allowing a sequence name, like ""prev"" or ""next"", or anything else can be handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have to go fix the selection processing code to allow it. but, while i was playing there, i noticed something i never new before. if you type ""66+"" the ""66"" changes to ""67"" (and so on, for each + that is typed). i suspect that's perhaps an artifact of ""+ is bound to a different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the current and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current input mode is a message number, so let it mean..."", but now i found it, i think its nice. but if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well? that kind of limitation bugs me, so i fixed it. and then i wondered about folders with names containing '+' - the special use of + as the toggle character means there's no way to type those from the keyboard. so i fixed that as well. this makes two different restrictions - there's no way to type a folder name that has a name beginning with '+' (but such a thing in mh would be a pain to use anyway, so i doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to toggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name being typed is empty. i'm less happy about that part, but i think i can live with it in order to allow folder names with +'s in them to exist and be typed. then, since i was there anyway, i decided to do something about another feature that has always bugged me. in ""normal"" keyboard mode, 's' is the key used to show a message. but if you've just typed 123, and the ftoc is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now show that message, you can't type 's', you have to type \r instead. so i ""fixed"" this one as well. ""fixed"" here is in quotes, as it assumes that the keybinding for msgshow is 's', if you change that to something else, it will remain 's' in here. i don't know enough tk/tcl to have it discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order to bind the same one here. \r continues to work of course. and now i got started in fixing irritants in this code, i also made it clear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^c or ^g). previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next message appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had reverted to its usual bindings. in any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that. i believe that if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the ""catch"" around the ""msgshow"" will hide the problem (i don't think we really need to fix brent's way of invoking it). or include it anyway, just for completeness (i haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but not the previous one, so i don't know for sure that all will be ok then). kre --- select.tcl.was thu aug 22 21:15:07 2002 +++ select.tcl wed aug 28 13:36:17 2002 @@ -49,9 +49,11 @@ bindtags $w [list $w entry] bind $w <any-key> {selecttypein %w %a} bind $w <key-plus> {selecttoggle %w } + bind $w <key-minus> {selectprev %w } bind $w <space> {selectcomplete %w} bind $w <tab> {selectcomplete %w} bind $w <return> {selectreturn %w} + bind $w <key-s> {selectreturn %w %a} bind $w <backspace> {selectbackspace %w} bind $w <control-h> {selectbackspace %w} bind $w <delete> {selectbackspace %w} @@ -72,7 +74,7 @@ append select(sel) $a exmh_status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)"" if ![info exists select(folder)] { - msg_change $select(sel) noshow + catch { msg_change $select(sel) noshow } } } proc selectbackspace { w } { @@ -91,6 +93,10 @@ proc selecttoggle {w} { global select if [info exists select(folder)] { + if {$select(sel) != """"} { + selecttypein $w + + return + } set select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]] set select(prompt) ""[lindex $select(toggle) 0] folder:"" } else { @@ -101,6 +107,18 @@ } exmh_status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)"" } +proc selectprev {w} { + global select + if [info exists select(folder)] { + selecttypein $w ""-"" + } else { + catch { + incr select(sel) -1 + msg_change $select(sel) noshow + } + exmh_status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)"" + } +} proc selectcomplete { w } { global select if [info exists select(folder)] { @@ -126,9 +144,13 @@ exmh_status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)"" } } -proc selectreturn { w } { +proc selectreturn { w {a {}} } { global select if [info exists select(folder)] { + if {$a != {}} { + selecttypein $w $a + return + } if [info exists select(match)] { set select(sel) $select(match) unset select(match) @@ -151,6 +173,7 @@ unset select(folder) } $select(entry) configure -state disabled + exmh_status """" exmh_focus } proc selectclear { w } { _______________________________________________ exmh-workers mailing list exmh-workers@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers",0

''i think that these buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago, when the last temple was fully operating,"" mr hang sithim said. provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the buddhist community at the temple to take care of them. ''we believe they are safe there,'' said som somphat, deputy governor of kampong thom province. ''the people of po pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.'' reign of terror a police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters. the khmer rouge waged civil war in cambodia between 1970 and 1998 and controlled the country between 1975 and 1979. the regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadent or culturally impure. about two million people died in the khmer rouge's drive to turn cambodia into a farmers' utopia. ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~--> 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-> to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/",0

the average salary for a university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is c$ 21,000 -- < $14,000 us. no wonder half of san francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call centers that have arrived here in the last couple of years - i think they hire some entry level it people for around $10 ($6 us) an hour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in 1986, paid $11.00 an hour. the fundamental difference is that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.in other words, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, union dues are a better investment than tuition. the counter-argument to this is that many college graduates leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is that we are the thin edge (one of several really - prison labor in the us would be another) of third-world wages and work practices coming to north america. i worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. the fact that they could maintain that (and prosper) just says volumes about the economy in this part of the world. i met many people there, like me, who felt that was fine, i can vote with my feet. they didn't quite realize that just about every large employer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. anyway eventually they started a union drive. during the vote, retired employees were brought in by the employer (rumours were that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of rum) and somehow allowed to vote . the union filed a grievance - which was denied - by a minister of labour, who, hey, guess what - used to be a vp at the company. that's free labor markets at work. the business continues to prosper - as i was told when i was there - it is a cash cow as long as the joa (joint operating agreement) with the competing paper is in place. and if you think that any of those wonderful american companies, out of some free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent, are going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received generous subsidies, in return, i'm sure, for an understanding about the labor markets here. > >btw, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country, >*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes, >all those smart people in the forbes 400 would have *more* money, and >there would be *more* self-made people on that list. in addition, >most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have >*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. finally, practically >all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and >not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not. > >that efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in the >people's republics of berkeley or cambridge. it means more and better >stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept >apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd >know about it by now. in economic terms, it's also called an increase >in general welfare, and, no, virginia, i'm not talking about >extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who >doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some >politician as santa claus come election time... > > much as i like to accept what you say - i do believe in free markets , i have difficulty finding any - except of course for labor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well unless the supply is tight) it was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the self-made billionaires on the list, but now we've got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the concept of ""more stuff, cheaper"" which it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. a particularly galling example is high-speed internet access. an article i read a couple of years ago that it is an area where the pricing approaches of the it industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the telecom industry (maintain your monopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through the same regulators) meet. sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. the whole entertainment industry/riaa/palladium thing seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer seems less important than using regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to produce profits for the favored few. > >in short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not >theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and >redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just >that: horseshit, happy or otherwise. > >to believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time marx >wrote capital and the manifesto -- romantic nonsense. > > i usually agree - but when there's a republican in office - i feel like they're the biggest believers in the manifesto, in reverse. create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the rights of that ""proletariat"" you've just created with bogus ""law and order"" policies , concentrate capital in the hands of a few (ideally people who can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. oh, and lie - use the word ""compassionate"" a lot. i guess i tend to believe that a certain amount of poverty reduction actually helps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the republic party seems to be the more homeless under each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be. and the facts are, for most people in the western world are declining standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net, greater working hours, essentially since the entrance of women into the work force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining standards of living) is the reality. again to quote that wonderfully liberal document i keep coming back to - the cia world factbook - on the us economy: ""since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20% of households"" owen",0

'deserved death' chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his crime. lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if chapman were released. lennon's songwriting partnership with paul mccartney propelled the liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled commercial success. the beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would have been 62 on wednesday. ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~--> plan to sell a home? http://us.click.yahoo.com/j2snna/y.leaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-> to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/",0

343,343,"from http://www.arstechnica.com/ ""there has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the department of justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against individuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted material over the internet. deputy assistant attorney general john malcolm believes that ""criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to preserve the viability of america's content industries."" malcolm also believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are participating in a legal activity. i certainly think people who download copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of copyrighted works. ""some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...i think they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal prosecution,"" said [riaa president cary] sherman, who was on the same conference panel. i'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect sherman is hoping for. although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. criminal lawsuits carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate further animosity against groups such as the riaa and may be difficult to initiate because of the ""schooling"" effect of millions of systems participating in file sharing. only servers would seem to stand out from the crowd. the article cites the no electronic theft (net) act [2], which defines illegal activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement: criminal infringement: any person who infringes a copyright willfully for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000.... for purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish willful infringement. ... the term ""financial gain"" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works. therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as ""financial gain"" even if no money is involved. the net act excerpt does not clarify how the value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15 to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the perspective of the consumer or copyright holder. the statute of limitations: 507. limitations on actions (a) criminal proceedings.--no criminal proceeding shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five years after the cause of action arose. (b) civil actions.--no civil action shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued. the penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in section 2319: criminal infringement of a copyright. in general, first-time criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year. i'm still not sure where the doj would start in choosing people to prosecute because of the aforementioned ""schooling"" effect, but my guess would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. thanks to monalisaoverdrive for pointing out this story.

""i don't remember packing that,"" i said. i let her confiscate it. i called my mom. she doesn't remember packing it either. is there some sort of terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? i can't see why this would be useful. how would they know what plane i'm on? once i'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? they could threaten me, but if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the scissors? perhaps it's some sort of matroishca-doll system. they use their fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _a new kind of science_, they use anks to bludgeon a 5th grader into giving them a wedge block, and they use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. those are some pretty clever terrorists. *update:* false alarm. my mom called. apparently it was the scissors she was using to cut loose threads from my tie last night. it must have fallen in. the nation can go back to yellow level terrorist alert. === waiting for wireless === now i am at o'hare airport, sitting outside the admiral's club while businessmen walk in and out. i am looking for a wireless signal, the signal i used last time i was here, but not finding it. of course, last time i was here, i had an admiral's club card. this time i have a mileage plus card, but despite the airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, you know)--i doubt they will accept it. === irony === according to the announcement i just heard, mr. valenti is going to miss his flight. i think of what i'd say if i ran into him. ""jack!"" i'd exclaim, as if we were old pals. ""going to the eldred case?"" of course he was. ""going to be a good one."" ""hey, remember when you had that debate with lessig?"" i'd ask. ""you said you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the internet. what ever happened to that?"" i imagine him mumbling and looking down at his watch. his plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. another announcement: mr. michael mckenna needs to call his office. good thing these airline announcements keep me up to date. === automatic flush toilets === now i am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. in the first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little short...), the flush went off once accidentally. ok, i thought, i can handle one mistake. then it went off again. here at the airport, it misfired three times. this is annoying and inexcusable. have they not heard of user testing? do they expect only tall people to use these bathrooms? this problem must be remedied immediately. i recommend releasing a service pack on the manufacturer's web site. === arrival === i've arrived in d.c.--once again, i'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the sidewalk borrowing someone's connection. trip was very smooth, had lunch with lisa and went to the spy museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). now for the meetings and parties. sorry for not responding to your email. i'm rather busy. ;-)",0

399,399,"anyone who doesn't appreciate both pluck and luck is only looking at part of the equation. america has, in fact, moved hard toward meritocracy. but -- and this is a huge one -- you don't necessarily find it on the forbes list. there is an element of luck, even if only being in the right place at the right time, to go that high. beyond the forbes list, there are many ways in which almost pure luck is involved in significant wealth. being a super-model, for example. though i think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models. cindy crawford was valedictorian of her high school. most people, of course, aren't in those stratified realms. it is the rest of us who tend to sort. there is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of merit in the first place. rawls claims merit doesn't exist. sowell seems to agree at least in part, but i'm sure sowell would also state that the benefits of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous. and if merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring? iq? purity of heart? or the ability to satisfy customers? functionally most people seem to equate merit with iq though they say it would be better if it were purity of heart. yet the type of merit that lands you on the forbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door' is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition. differences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far more animosity than differences due to luck. luck can be forgiven. superior performance, often not. > -----original message----- > from: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] on behalf of geege > schuman > sent: monday, september 23, 2002 4:44 pm > to: r. a. hettinga; geege schuman; owen byrne > cc: gary lawrence murphy; mr. fork; fork@example.com; digital bearer > settlement list > subject: re: comrade communism (was re: crony capitalism (was re: sed > /s/united states/roman empire/g)) > > first, misattribution. i did not write the blurb below. i made one > statement about vp cheney only, to wit, that he has a short memory. > > i couldn't agree with you more on this: ""in short, then, economics is not > a > zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the > backs > of the poor, and redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit > is just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise,"" however, i resent being > lumped > in a zero-sum-zealot category for suggesting nothing more than that rich > and > successful at face value is apropos of nothing and i am beginning to > understand that people who immediately and so fiercely object to my ad > hominem (re cheney) align themselves weird sylogisms like ""if rich then > deservedly"" or ""if rich then smarter."" given that, i am also beginning to > understand why some people need to be rich. > > wrt to meritocracies - all hail, meritocracies! wrt harvard: over 90% of > 2002 graduates were cum laude +. interesting curve. those eager to be > measured got their wish; those unwashed shy folk who just live it provide > the balast. > > speaking of forbes, was reading about peter norton just today in an old > issue while waiting for my doctor. norton attributes his success to luck. > imagine. > > geege > > -----original message----- > from: r. a. hettinga [mailto:rah@shipwright.com] > sent: sunday, september 22, 2002 10:01 pm > to: geege schuman; owen byrne > cc: gary lawrence murphy; mr. fork; fork@example.com; digital bearer > settlement list > subject: comrade communism (was re: crony capitalism (was re: sed > /s/united states/roman empire/g)) > > > -----begin pgp signed message----- > hash: sha1 > > at 11:15 am -0400 on 9/22/02, geege schuman wrote: > > > > most of them seem to have ivy league educations, or are ivy league > > dropouts suggesting to me that they weren't exactly poor to start > > with. > > actually, if i remember correctly from discussion of the list's > composition in forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to > get on the forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. can you say > ""bootstraps"", boys and girls?

402,402,"http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,7493,781769,00.html hamza's horrid - but we must tolerate him rod liddle wednesday august 28, 2002 the guardian sheikh abu hamza al-masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing with his own children in victoria park, hackney. i've often wondered what incendiary islamic fundamentalist clerics do on statutory public holidays. head for the beach and maybe swing by b&q on the way home, i had hoped. i had this beguiling vision of hamza paddling in the sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins, and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen for once, instead of planning the extermination of zionism and america and maybe me and you, too. but b&q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond hamza's budget since the bank of england froze his assets, so victoria park had to do. but he sounded happy enough when i spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, islamic proto-warriors in the background. you must know hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the daily mail's cartoonist mac. large metal hook in place of a left hand. one eye covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. we don't mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like hamza whom we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come off. so hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the british right) as ""captain hook"", in articles which usually call for his arrest, or extradition to the us, or deportation back home to egypt or maybe off to pakistan or afghanistan, where he fought the russians for years and thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. and if we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him to shut up. because we don't like hamza very much. we weren't that fond of him before september 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political persecution. and now the daily mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of islam. all out of context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. but perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and tolerance towards people like hamza was thinning even before the mirror's scoop. hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary finsbury park mosque - so, earlier this year, the charity commissioners banned him from doing so because of his allegedly inflammatory remarks. i didn't know charity commissioners were meant to do stuff like that. he has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been frozen. he is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations and the press. and this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly - repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be true - hamza is not ""representative"" of british muslims, as if british muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could turn to every now and then for explanation. and perhaps succour. the trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was revealed to be rather more ""representative"" than the list of those government-approved muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, i suspect - dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism and a blanket condemnation of the taliban. an opinion poll commissioned by radio 4's today programme revealed that an overwhelming majority of british muslims were against george bush's crusade. one in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the us (the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). a large majority thought the war against terrorism was a war against islam. which is what hamza said, repeatedly. but it was something that, at the time, we didn't want to hear. now, if you quiz the man on present policy at home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from the liberal left. no war against iraq; britain to become independent of us foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with arab states; stronger action against israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth. nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as i can tell, although i don't suppose he will be holidaying in eilat this year. in yesterday's guardian, the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to hamza and was grateful for the sheikh's message of condolence when a london synagogue was attacked. which is not to say that hamza is a peaceable jeffersonian democrat who has been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. his ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of islam: he would be happy, in a truly islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for example. you and i would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly repellent. and that's the point. because hamza is the true test of our apparent desire to be multicultural. multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the ruling hegemony. that is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism. multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them. the fbi has been investigating hamza, but, of course, has found nothing remotely incriminating. the real reason for his vilification and persecution is simply the pungency of his views. it is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his rhetoric increases hostility against the muslim population generally. this is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash. you don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. and if british muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is not because they have been led in that direction by hamza. shutting the man up, therefore, won't make a difference. it is rather as louis macneice had it: the glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever. but if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather. ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~--> 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-> to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/",0

(the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed btw) most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were talking about originally. even 10 seconds is pushing the ""capactior is the wrong choice"" limits. thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one, it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady discharge curve. but it should be safe to say that most people want the indy 500 version, not the 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) for those you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole atoms, not just electrons. then you can suck off the electrons you need with a fuel cell. however, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel, and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design. - adam l.

""duncan"" beberg http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/ beberg@mithral.com -------- epa: diesel exhaust can cause cancer wed sep 4, 3:29 am et by h. josef hebert, associated press writer washington (ap) - inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other sources over time can cause cancer in humans, an environmental protection agency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study. the epa finding, released tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines and diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content. while acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of exposure to diesel exhausts, the epa report said studies involving both animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer risk to humans. ""it is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental exposure levels"" as well, the report said. ""the potential human health effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and uncertainties are involved."" the report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various world health agencies and studies in california and is particularly significant because the epa is the federal agency that regulates diesel emissions under the clean air act. some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the bush administration might try to back away from a clinton-era regulation that would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel. epa administrator christie whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with the tougher truck and diesel rules. last month, with white house approval, the epa rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone the requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to meet an october deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines. the engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road, although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel is expected to produce pollution reductions. the epa's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to diesel exhaust. such a risk assessment is commonly made by the epa when gauging pollution health concerns. but in this case, the report said, ""the exposure-response data are considered too uncertain"" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of cancer risk to an individual. nevertheless, said the report, the ""totality of evidence from human, animal and other supporting studies"" suggests that diesel exhaust ""is likely to be carcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to environmental exposure."" the report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses short-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a ""chronic respiratory hazard to humans"" contributing to increased asthma and other respiratory problems. in some urban areas diesel exhausts account for as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said. environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road diesel-powered vehicles. epa spokeswoman steffanie bell said the agency expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust sources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment. emily figdor of the u.s. public interest research group, a private environmental organization, said: ""to reduce the public's exposure to harmful diesel emissions, the bush administration should ... fully implement clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent standards for diesel construction and farm equipment."" allen schaeffer, executive director of the industry group diesel technology forum, said the epa's report ""focused on the past,"" whereas ""the future is clean diesel. diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times cleaner than just a dozen years ago."" the report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in the mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.",0

""the problem with the french,"" bush afterwards confided in blair, ""is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur."" the source was shirley williams, also known as the baroness williams of crosby, who claimed ""my good friend tony blair"" had recently regaled her with this anecdote in brighton. lloyd grove of the washington post was unable to reach baroness williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did receive a call from alastair campbell, blair's director of communications and strategy. ""i can tell you that the prime minister never heard george bush say that, and he certainly never told shirley williams that president bush did say it,"" campbell told the post. ""if she put this in a speech, it must have been a joke."" this is far from the first time bush has been made the butt of a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than stellar intellectual abilities. without straining our memories too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've chronicled on this site. in the summer of 2001, the joke of the moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the ranking of presidential iqs, with george w. bush being pegged as the chief executive who scraped the bottom of the intelligence barrel. in december 2000 it was a fake nostradamus quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win the 2000 presidential election. and in the spring of 2002, it was the story of bush's waving at stevie wonder that set folks to chortling up their sleeves. stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual shortcoming will always waft after george w. bush because they seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever been. it is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always fall upon appreciative ears. barbara ""ears of corn"" mikkelson last updated: 29 july 2002 http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

""she must have adopted her on sunday because they are in harmony,"" said gabriel lepariyo, a warden. naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a distance. theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, kamuniak is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour and confusing the hunter; kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; kamuniak wants to be loved. ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~--> sell a home with ease! http://us.click.yahoo.com/srpzmc/ktmeaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-> to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/",0

""0 control panel[3]"", ""1 mozilla[4]"", ""2 emacs[5]"", ""3 dos home"", ""4 dos work"", ""5 dos incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, but in different directories), ""7 python[6]"", ""9 ie"". also ""# explorer home"", ""$ explorer work"", ""% explorer incoming"", which open explorer windows in various useful directories (the same directories as the dos shortcuts, only with the shift key held down, and yes, i intentionally set it up so that $ went to my work folder). less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus (as installed) and moved directly into the programs submenu and given unique first letters as needed. ""ad-aware[7]"", ""excel[8]"", ""im"", ""netscape 4[9]"", ""paint shop pro"", ""query tool (odbc)[10]"", ""vmware[11]"", ""word[12]"". all other submenus except startup are removed from the programs menu. (yes, delete ""accessories"". do you honestly ever use it? if so, it's probably a sign of a larger productivity problem.) things which never need to be run manually (like winzip and quicktime) are removed from the programs menu. maintaining a clean programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. on most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your fingers off the home keys. otherwise ctrl esc always works. menu 4 gives me a new command prompt in my work directory. menu p n runs netscape 4 (for compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). mozilla and emacs are almost always open, but i quit lesser-used applications as soon as i'm done using them (mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). i install cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. cygwin is a collection of windows ports of all your favorite unix utilities, including mv, cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. and bash, which i don't use because i dislike how it handles windows pathnames. i also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 3000. set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the window. in mozilla, i set my home page to ""about:blank"", set internet search to search with google, use tabbed browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the background). under scripts & plugins, i do not allow scripts to open unrequested windows. i turn off the sidebar, turn on the site navigation bar, delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], from which i can find all other bookmarks i need. in internet explorer, i set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since that's the only thing i do in internet explorer. alt tab back and forth between mozilla and ie is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within mozilla, since textareas in mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. i use emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of emacs is so heinous as to render it unusable. (for instance, editing a cgi script named foo.cgi on a web server with emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. try this sometime on your favorite web site.) among other things, my .emacs file (which is actually called _emacs on windows) instructs emacs to store all backup files in a single directory (d:\backup); to treat all xml files as docbook, all cgi scripts as python, and all sql scripts as pl/sql; to use cygwin's bash shell for m-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept ""y"" and ""n"" for yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when i press m-w. i use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get all text files to open in emacs. (i got this idea from ultraedit[15].) my _emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. i don't use windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. on my d drive i have d:\home (contains directories for my books and other personal projects, each under cvs control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the home environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work project, also under cvs), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by emacs, and for temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly created cvs projects). i don't know or care what's where on my c drive. i have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. it is not in any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank lines between entries. i categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses after their name, and use m-x-occur in emacs to search by keyword. this file is my single most backed-up possession. other essential free windows utilities i use (in no particular order): tweakui [16], cygwin[17], guidescope[18], zonealarm[19].

493,493,"hindus mourn 'monkey god' by omer farooq bbc reporter in hyderabad hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became revered as a divine incarnation of a hindu god in the southern indian state of andhra pradesh. the monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion after being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers. the animal was cremated in anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles) south of the state capital, hyderabad, on sunday. it had not eaten for three weeks. last rites were performed by priests in the village of timmiganipally in the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the monkey was a reincarnation of the hindu monkey god, hanuman. garlanded one animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had failed because of the blind faith of the people. the monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal out of the temple, but were prevented by villagers. the monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of hanuman a month ago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages, as well as from the neighbouring state of karnataka. devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it around the clock. 'exploited' locals said they believed that lord hanuman was visiting the village, as the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of residents. but animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being mistreated. they filed a petition in the state's high court saying the monkey had been forcibly confined in the temple. the group also alleged that people's religious feelings were being exploited to make money. the court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - but villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.",0

(actually, i do, and the database blows the pickle out of the water, but it scores every word with 0.00, so i'm not sure that's a fair test. ;) in any case, 21mb per user is probably too large, and 10mb is questionable. on the other hand, my pickle compressed very well with gzip, shrinking down to 1.8mb. neale",0

""this is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,"" said max barclay, the curator of beetles at the natural history museum in london who discovered the creatures in the uk. the black vine weevil has long been native to britain, causing enormous damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. but the two new species, otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known north of switzerland, are now prevalent in south london. ""it's very likely these weevils have been introduced to britain through imported ornamental plants from italy,"" said dr barclay. ""it looks like they're here to stay."" he found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a chelsea department store in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a migrant. it has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in south-west london. the second invader is not so numerous, but has established itself firmly in the same area. apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and grape vines. an early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. the soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface. one possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of britain is global warming. earlier springs and milder winters are already a fact. ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~--> sell a home with ease! http://us.click.yahoo.com/srpzmc/ktmeaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-> to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/",0

554,554,"how about this: a bored forker said: ""yawn"" i believe tom had it right. signal not noise. i'll start: los angeles times september 23, 2002 monday copyright 2002 / los angeles times los angeles times september 23, 2002 monday home edition section: main news main news; part 1; page 13; national desk length: 1013 words byline: dana calvo, times staff writer dateline: seattle body: the idea came at the end of a long, frustrating brown-bag session at a public-policy think tank here. the challenge was to save the city's child-care programs. staring into his empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator's mind landed on an unlikely solution: put a tax--just a ""benign"" dime a shot--on espresso. that led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 seattle residents, and next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes law, one that taps right into seattle's legendary addiction to coffee. this is, after all, the town where starbucks was born and where the $12 pound of beans became a staple. there is one starbucks for every 7,000 residents in seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in new york. seattle also has two other major coffee chains, tully's coffee and seattle's best coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts. a recent poll showed that 74% of seattle residents would vote for the tax. ""for people outside of seattle who don't understand the consumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,"" said john burbank, the think tank's executive director, ""but it was common sense."" research by his nonprofit economic opportunity institute showed that people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. but because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol. burbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a year. city council aides dispute his figures, saying their research shows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year. burbank's institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. the think tank's mission is to promote public policy in the interests of low-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues. burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs made earlier this year by gov. gary locke. he also says it would provide more low-income families with subsidies for child care, improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries. at bauhaus books & coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of customers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink. espresso lovers like chris altman, who at a dime a day would spend an extra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. ""i'm ok with it,"" said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. ""the money's got to come from somewhere."" hope revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she brought her own mug) and reading ""zen and the art of pottery."" she supports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be expected of espresso drinkers: they want the most expensive thing on the menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy. some say the tax isn't the issue; they just resent being singled out. david marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a day, which means he'd be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. ""i, for one, don't have kids, but i drink espresso,"" he said, as he sewed a leather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. ""i don't mind paying, but i think everyone should pay."" coffeehouses are steamed about it, and they've organized as jolt--joined to oppose the latte tax. among the members are seattle's chamber of commerce and the city's two largest coffee franchises, starbucks and tully's. the tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that contains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare for smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. if espresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a city audit. university of chicago economics professor michael greenstone said the tax doesn't add up. ""the purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is neither,"" he said. ""on the efficiency side, it's surely going to lead to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to avoid the tax. for example, starbucks could claim that they are using finely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker] and that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. would they be right? i don't know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal fees that could have gone to child care. ""of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingenious idea, and i mean that in a cynical way. they've pitted espresso drinkers against child-care supporters, and who's going to side with the espresso drinkers?"" in fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political two-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public stance of political correctness. in a liberal city like seattle, corporations continually advertise their commitment to social activism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, jolt members prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care. ""starbucks will continue to support early-learning and childhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we contribute annually,"" the company said. ""however, starbucks does not understand why the economic opportunity institute would recommend an additional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single consumer product."" the city council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before voters next year. the initiative's authors say it is directed at vendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through higher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee. the tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of espresso, including decaf. drip coffee would be exempt. burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. so, he's been pitching it as a modern-day robin hood tax, where the needy get a dime every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso. it's the kind of political marketing that fran beulah, 43, finds funny.
